His films have been shown in more than 100 festivals in about 20 countries.\n\nHis strong obsession towards cells forces him to draw every frame with surprising density. His rhythmical animation overwhelms viewers. Recently he has been trying to step into new territory: minimalistic abstract animation using linear figures.\n\nMirai Mizue was born in 1981 in Tokyo and studied animation at Tama Arts University from 2002. He is known by his affection towards cells in his non-narrative animation films. His films have been nominated in some major animation festivals like Annecy, Zagreb, Ottawa and Hiroshima. DEVOUR DINNER won the Second Prize in Animadrid. In SICAF he made a commissioned film from the festival in 2009 and was a member of Selection Committees in 2010.\n\nAs an illustrator, he provides his drawings to some Japanese novelists. He is also a member of Japan Animation Association and a teacher in O-HARA school.\n\n(Source: calf.jp)",
