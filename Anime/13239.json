He debuted as an in-betweener on [Osomatsu-kun](https://anilist.co/anime/9883/) and as a key animator on [Laughing Salesman](https://anilist.co/anime/3077/).\n\nIt's on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392//) that Nishio came into his own as an animator, developing weighty and realistic movements influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). Thanks to the ability demonstrated there, he was chosen to design the characters for [Ninku](https://anilist.co/anime/912/).\n\nAfter working as character designer and chief animation director on [Jin-Roh](https://anilist.co/anime/570/) he permanently joined Production I.G. where he became known, together with [Hiroyuki Okiura](https://anilist.co/staff/103502/) and [Kazuchika Kise](https://anilist.co/staff/115781/), as \"The Three Gods of I.G.\"\n\n[Masashi Kishimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96879/) requested for Nishio to be the character designer of the Naruto anime.\n\nIn August 2020, he was promoted to company director of Production I.G alongside [Takayuki Gotou](https://anilist.co/staff/103266/Takayuki-Gotou/), a co-founder of the studio.",
