  "description": "Three hundred years ago, in the frigid land of Siberia, Jubei Yagyu engaged in a fierce battle with Kitaretsusai of the Northern Yagyu clan. The duel was costly, as his daughter Freesia was frozen in suspended animation. As a result of global warming in the present day, Freesia breaks free from her icy grave and moves to Japan as a middle school transfer student, where she befriends Jiyuu Nanohana. Little does Jiyuu know that Freesia is targeting her to acquire the coveted Lovely Eye Patch, which Freesia believes is rightfully hers.<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Although Daichi was an aspiring stage photographer he instead joined animation photography company Tokyo Animation Film where he continued to work for 5 years, although he temporarily changed jobs and shot live-action karaoke videos instead. In 1991 he left his employer, worked at a game production for half a year, and returned to the animation industry where he would study under animation director [Tetsuo Yasumi](https://anilist.co/staff/111207/). Daichi would advance into episode direction and caught the eyes of [Tatsuo Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/100391/) and [Hiroaki Sakurai](https://anilist.co/staff/101153/) who were impressed with his work on [*Akazukin Chacha*](https://anilist.co/anime/103/Akazukin-Chacha). Daichi made his solo directorial debut in 1995 with [*Nurse Angel Ririka SOS*](https://anilist.co/anime/616/Nurse-Angel-Ririka-SOS). Since 2015 he serves as scriptwriter and director for [*Kodomo no Omocha*](https://anilist.co/anime/1486/Kodomo-no-Omocha/)'s stage version of which he directed the anime as well. Presently he's a freelance director.\n\n**Style**\nHe specializes in high-tension comedy and often includes comedy and lighthearted moments even in more serious works. In his comedies he often smoothly deforms the characters far beyond their design, inspired by gag manga king [Fujio Akatsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/97141/). His directing work tends to include live-action images or brief flashbacks from past episodes. Since childhood Daichi became affected and inspired by the works of famous jidaigeki actor *Joushirou Konoe* inspiring him to make more historical samurai works.\n\nDaichi is particular about choosing voice actors and has discovered several talents such as [Ayaka Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/95222/), [Nozomi Sasaki](https://anilist.co/staff/95580/), and [Reiko Yasuhara](https://anilist.co/staff/95373/). \n\n**Accolades**\n- [*Ojarumaru*](https://anilist.co/anime/4459/Ojarumaru) won the 1999 Japan Media Arts Festival Animation Excellence Award.\n- [*Maksete Iruka!*](https://anilist.co/anime/2791/Makasete-Iruka/) won the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival Animation Excellence Award.\n- [*Gyagu Manga Biyori*](https://anilist.co/anime/1196/Gyagu-Manga-Biyori) was recommended by the Japan Media Arts Festival Animation committee in 2005.\n\n**Controversies**\nIn 2018 and 2019 voice actress [Hiroko Konishi](https://anilist.co/staff/96545/Hiroko-Konishi) alleged that she was propositioned by her manager to enter a mixed bath with Daichi in the nude and was blacklisted from the voice acting industry when she refused.",

          "description": "As is the case with many Japanese artists, her privacy was well guarded; little is known about her life apart from her artistic career. \n\nDuring the 90s, she continued singing and also wrote for anime voice actors. From 2000, she became involved in earnest with anime and composed several songs for Wedding Peach, Fruits Basket and Love Hina. She formed the duo Melocure in 2002 with singer-songwriter Megumi Hinata, and in the following two years, the duo released several singles and an album, Melodic Hard Cure. Okazaki also produced songs during these years for artists such as Megumi Hayashibara, Mayumi Iizuka, and Yui Horie.  Her work consists mainly of ballads, and can be categorised within the spectrum of Japanese music as most closely related to J-Pop. According to her fans, the lyrics of Okazaki's songs are characterized by poetic imagery, depth of emotion, gentle optimism and simplicity.  \n\nOn May 5, 2004, Ritsuko Okazaki died suddenly at the age of 44 from septic shock as a result of septicemia. She was unable to speak any last words, and left her work unfinished. ",
