She has one elder and one younger sister and one brother. She hates to lose (in every point of view) and she loves the Margaret Magazine of Shueisha. She says that she is too fat and that she dislikes her face. She has two cats named Riku and Kai, and at Tanemura's homepage you can find many photos of them. She wants to draw like no-one else (she can't lose...) and she loves to go to karaoke with her assistants (friends). She is good friends with the manga-ka [Ryo Maekawa](https://anilist.co/staff/98904/Ryo-Maekawa) and [Ruka Kazuki](https://anilist.co/staff/100291/Ruka-Kazuki).\n\nShe's not really a fan of yaoi (boys' love) manga, but she has made a yaoi doujinshi (no specified title) for one of her friends. She has also made a few adults-only comics on Full Moon wo Sagashite and Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne.\n\nHer nicknames include the sobriquets \"Arinacchi\" and \"Arinaccho\" (Arinaccho is a humorous play on Arinacchi, and was said just because of the ridiculousness of it all).\n\nArina participated in Shinshi Doumei Cross drama CDs as [Yoshitaka Ichinomiya](https://anilist.co/character/3507/Yoshitaka-Ichinomiya) and Postman.",
