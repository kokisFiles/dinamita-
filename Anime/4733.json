After a colleague had pointed this out it started bothering him and he went through great effort to gradually establish his own unique visual style which he is known for today. His career as an animator was short-lived as he realized that he was more interested in just drawing pictures rather than moving them around, and naturally shifted his activities from animation to illustrations and manga.",
