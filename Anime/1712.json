  "description": "Mars is discovered on a forming volcano island, Heisei; a man with no memory. In reality, Mars is from outer space, and is supposed to gather information to decide whether Earth should be destroyed or not. Along with the giant robot Gaia, and his mysterious images of a woman urging him not to destroy the world, Mars decides to fight for Earth rather than destroy it, even if it means fighting his own kind. But if Mars is killed, Gaia will explode, destroying Earth along with it.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "[Official Website](https://yokoyama-mitsuteru.com/)\n\nMitsuteru Yokoyama was a Japanese manga artist born in Suma Ward of Kobe City in Hyōgo Prefecture.\nYokoyama spent his boyhood during World War II and was evacuated to Tottori with his family. He graduated from Kobe municipal Ota junior high school and went on to the Kobe municipal Suma high school. [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/Osamu-Tezuka)'s \"Metropolis\" made a deep impression on Yokoyama who wished to become a manga artist in earnest and so he contributed his works to a comic book in his high school days.\nYokoyama came out with the book \"Otonashi no Ken (音無しの剣 Sword without sound)\" for his manga artist début, which caught [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/Osamu-Tezuka)'s attention.\nCreated the very first \"Giant Robot\" series, Tetsujin 28 (Gigantor) in 1956. Also created the first \"Magical Girl\" series, Sally the Witch, in 1966.\n\nDied from a house fire in 2004, aged 69.",
