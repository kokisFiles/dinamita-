          "description": "An animator turned mangaka, Yasuhiko was born in Hokkaido in December 1947, he dropped out of Hirosaki University in 1970 to work for MushiPro as an animator. In the 70s he became a freelancer and worked on TV anime. Some of his most famous work as a character designer or director are \"Space Battleship Yamato\", \"Brave Raideen\", \"Combattler V\" and \"Mobile Suit Gundam\".\n\nIn 1979, he made his debut as a mangaka with \"Arion\" serialized in the newly founded magazine \"Ryu\". Following this, Yasuhiko alternated between the Anime and Manga worlds with works like \"Kiba - The Legend of White Fang\", \"Crusher Joe\", and \"Giant Gorg\", and \"Star of the Kurds\", \"C-Court\", and \"Venus Wars\".\n\nThese worlds would overlap, when his manga \"Arion\" would get adapted into an anime film in 1986 with the title \"Neo Heroic Fantasia: Arion\". Following this, he would adapt his SF Military Chronicle \"Venus Wars\" into an anime film in 1989. The anime film adaptation for \"Venus Wars\" came at an unfortunate point for Yasuhiko, and the film was sealed, preventing it from being made readily available on home video formats in Japan (though still made accessible overseas). He turned to manga completely and had gained a respectable reputation as a history mangaka with works focusing on both Japanese history with \"Jinmu\", \"Namuji\", \"Yamato Takeru\" and European history with \"Alexandros\", \"Joan\", and Theology with \"Jesus\".\n\nIn 2001 he adapted the First Gundam anime into a manga with \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\" and was colossally popular, being serialized for 24 Tankoban volumes.\n\nWith over 50 years worth of experience across multiple mediums of entertainment and showing no signs of stopping, Yasuhiko's terrific worldview continues to touch the hearts of many around the world.\n\nIn 1981, he won the Seiun Award in the Art category. In 1992, he received the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for his work \"Namuji\". From 1979 to 1982, he ranked first in the Anime Grand Prix for Character Design. In 2000, he won the Japan Media Arts Festival Excellence Prize in the Manga category for \"Ōdō no Inu\". In 2012, he won the Seiun Award in the Best Comic category for \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\". In 2015, he received the Animation Kobe Special Award.",

          "description": "As a teenager Yamashita was influenced by the works of [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/) and [Tomonori Kogawa](https://anilist.co/staff/105957/), and was inspired to become an animator.\n\nAfter graduating from Kurashiki Minami High School, he moved to Tokyo to become an animator and joined Bevore. After Bevore's dissolution, he joined Atelier Giga, and from there he joined Project Team Muu. There he was jointly in charge of the character designs, animation direction and storyboards for [Giant Robo the Animation: The Day the Earth Stood Still](https://anilist.co/anime/2321/). The production took nearly 10 years, during which Yamashita gave it his all. After the production was over he started losing his motivation for animation. Though, it sparked again, after having met [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on the opening animation for a video game called, Gensou Suikogaiden. \n\nIn 2001, Yamashita worked as a key animator on [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/), a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) feature film. There he was in charge of multiple scenes, most notably Chihiro and Haru's free fall at the end of the movie. This earned him high high praise from [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), and he was thus selected as one of the animation director's for [How's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/). Since then he has served as an animation director on most of Ghibli's movies.\n\nIn 2018, Yamashita directed \"The Invisible Man,\" a short film part of the anthology collection [Modest Heroes](https://anilist.co/anime/103887/), produced by [Studio Ponoc](https://anilist.co/studio/6147/). The film won the Newcomer's Award in the Animation Division at the 22nd Japan Media Arts Festival\n\nMarried to [Miho Shimogasa](https://anilist.co/staff/116279/).",

Vision (ADV), paving the way for other businesses and the exponential growth anime has had within North America. With ADV's success, Ledford turned his sights to making the imaginative world of anime even more accessible with Anime Network's founding, North America’s first cable TV network dedicated to anime. He later partnered with Kadokawa Publishing and began Newtype USA with translated Japanese content and exclusive U.S. material related to all things anime, manga, and model reviews. This endeavor expanded into ADV Manga, which obtained licensing and publishing rights for hundreds of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.\n\nIn 2008, Ledford founded a new anime-focused company called Sentai Filmworks (Sentai). Since its founding, Sentai provides thousands of hours of content across traditional and digital platforms. Sentai’s dedication to bringing captivating stories, including acclaimed titles such as Grave of the Fireflies, Ninja Scroll, and High School of the Dead to audiences, is ongoing.\n\nLedford’s most recent success is with the 2017 founding of the streaming service HIDIVE. Since launching, HIDIVE is now available via a web browser, mobile devices, gaming platforms, and more. HIDIVE offers new simulcasts every season, an ever-growing collection of dubs, and exclusive titles. The service features DUBCAST SM editions, early access local-language dubs of simulcasts directly produced by HIDIVE, as early as two weeks after the original Japanese broadcast.\n\nFor nearly thirty years now, Ledford continues his goal to further the expansion of anime and the Japanese culture as a whole.",
