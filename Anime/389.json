  "description": "The world of the humans and the world of the demons (y&#333;kai) have overlapped one another, leaving humans to walk the streets of life as they normally would, while demons walk, hidden from the naked eye, down the very same streets. A seemingly young woman named Yurine and her servant, the Karas (from the Japanese word for \"Crow\"), have long maintained order and balance between the overlapped worlds, ultimately keeping the demons from interrupting the lives of humans. However, humans have come to forget and jest at the existence of demons, and no longer understand the privilege it is to live without fear. Disgusted by this arrogance, an old Karas turns his back on the laws he had once upheld, and in his human form, named Eko, he creates an army of Mikura, or mechanized demons, to ready an attack on the human race.<br><br>\nA young man named Otoha inherits the powers of the Karas and takes his place at the side of Yurine, who claims that his soul called out for her while he lived the life of a human. They live in the world of the demons. It is now up to Otoha to prove himself as a Karas, and restore the balance that Eko threatens to upset.<br><br>\nMeanwhile, a superstitious police officer named Sagisaka and his rational new recruit, Kure, follow the trail of the murders dealt by Eko's Mikura, as well as the trail of a rogue Mikura named Nue. The prophecy unfolds from here into a grave revelation for all in the city.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She is currently signed to Phoerix Records as of mid-2005 and has released a total of 5 regular albums and 10 singles thus far. Rurutia is an intensely private artist; most aspects of her life - such as her age and her real name - are not known to the public. This fact, added to her whispered vocals, creates a unique and mysterious atmosphere around her.    Her pseudonym, Rurutia, means 'blissful rain' in Tahitian.    (Taken from Wikipedia entry)",

[Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/) and Bebow’s founder [Tomonori Kogawa](https://anilist.co/staff/105957/) were also graduates of the same school - the latter whom he would study under after joining the studio. There he made his debut as a key animator on [Seisenshi Dunbine](https://anilist.co/anime/929/) in the following year.\n\nHe left Bebow in the mid ‘80s and joined Pack, a small studio established by [Hiroyuki Kitazume](https://anilist.co/staff/106775/). During this time he was a follower of Kitazume’s, who has said that Onda was the one capable of replicating his drawing’s the best out of the people who worked at studio Pack. After that he joined [Atelier Giga](https://anilist.co/staff/106775/) and worked there until becoming a freelancer.\n\nHis drawings feature western-influenced delicate and sharp linework with an excellent grasp on three-dimensionality. His character art in particular is highly praised both inside and outside of the industry, which he gets to brandish whenever he works as an animation supervisor. He has stated that he prefers character design and supervision work over working as an animator himself.\n\nIn 2003, he took part as a key animator on [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/)'s animated segment in Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" directed by [Kazuto Nakazawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101474/).

After Bevore's dissolution, he joined Atelier Giga, and from there he joined Project Team Muu. There he was jointly in charge of the character designs, animation direction and storyboards for [Giant Robo the Animation: The Day the Earth Stood Still](https://anilist.co/anime/2321/). The production took nearly 10 years, during which Yamashita gave it his all. After the production was over he started losing his motivation for animation. Though, it sparked again, after having met [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on the opening animation for a video game called, Gensou Suikogaiden. \n\nIn 2001, Yamashita worked as a key animator on [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/), a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) feature film. There he was in charge of multiple scenes, most notably Chihiro and Haru's free fall at the end of the movie. This earned him high high praise from [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), and he was thus selected as one of the animation director's for [How's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/). Since then he has served as an animation director on most of Ghibli's movies.\n\nIn 2018, Yamashita directed \"The Invisible Man,\" a short film part of the anthology collection [Modest Heroes](https://anilist.co/anime/103887/), produced by [Studio Ponoc](https://anilist.co/studio/6147/). The film won the Newcomer's Award in the Animation Division at the 22nd Japan Media Arts Festival\n\nMarried to [Miho Shimogasa](https://anilist.co/staff/116279/).",

He debuted as an in-betweener on [Osomatsu-kun](https://anilist.co/anime/9883/) and as a key animator on [Laughing Salesman](https://anilist.co/anime/3077/).\n\nIt's on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392//) that Nishio came into his own as an animator, developing weighty and realistic movements influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). Thanks to the ability demonstrated there, he was chosen to design the characters for [Ninku](https://anilist.co/anime/912/).\n\nAfter working as character designer and chief animation director on [Jin-Roh](https://anilist.co/anime/570/) he permanently joined Production I.G. where he became known, together with [Hiroyuki Okiura](https://anilist.co/staff/103502/) and [Kazuchika Kise](https://anilist.co/staff/115781/), as \"The Three Gods of I.G.\"\n\n[Masashi Kishimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96879/) requested for Nishio to be the character designer of the Naruto anime.\n\nIn August 2020, he was promoted to company director of Production I.G alongside [Takayuki Gotou](https://anilist.co/staff/103266/Takayuki-Gotou/), a co-founder of the studio.",
