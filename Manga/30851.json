          "description": "__Zodiac Sign:__ Capricorn  \n\nFuyumi Soryou was born into the home of a master of the Kanze school of Noh. In her childhood she liked to draw pictures of horses and things but had no special interest in manga. She is a graduate of the Oita prefectural Geijutsu Midorigaoka High School.\n\nWhile enrolled in fashion college, she happened across Shogakukan's Rookie of the Year Contest and applied to raise money for the Souen fashion contest. There she received an honorable mention for her autobiographical short story, and started to work as an assistant for OGURA Fuyumi from whom she also drew her inspiration for her own pen name.\n\nShe debuted with \"Sunspot Visitor\" (Hidamari no houmonsha) published in the April 1982 edition of Bessatsu Shoujo Comic (now Bestucomi).\nIn 1988, she was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shoujo manga for Boyfriend.\n\nThe serialization of her Science-Fiction series Eternal Sabbath in the seinen magazine Morning in 2002 became the turning point of her career. Her current manga series Cesare is also published in Morning, and it centers around the infamous Borgia family of the Italian Renaissance and Cesare Borgia himself.\n\nSome of her short stories are autobiographical and deal with her own experiences as a mangaka.",
