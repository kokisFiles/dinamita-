  "description": "Aya, Yoji, Ken, and Omi are the four young men who comprise Weiss Kreuz (WK), an assassin group who eliminates certain menaces to society. Each member has his own trademark fighting style. Aya is adept at fighting with a katana, Yoji has mastered the art of strangulation via strings, Ken is lethal with his metal claws, while Omi specializes in a wide array of projectiles. Under the command of a mysterious man known only as \"Persia\", the WK is dispatched to take care of drug rings, terrorist factions, and the like. But as things go along, they discover that most, if not all, the bad elements they have dealt with are somehow connected to the Takatori family. The Takatori family is rich, powerful, and influential. It seems if the problem is to be nipped in the bud, the WK would have to put an end to one of Japan's most prominent clans. <br><br>\n(Source: AniDB) ",

          "description": "[Blog](http://koyap.jugem.jp/) | [Agency Profile](https://tsf-official.com/talent/takehito-koyasu/)\n\nKoyasu is the most prolific voice actor in the industry, having been credited for over 700 roles as of April 2022.\n\nGrowing up, Koyasu skipped out on going to school to watch movies at home because he wanted to become an actor. It wasn’t until later that he became interested in voice acting after having seen [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/). After graduation he entered a voice acting school. In 1988, he made his voice acting debut, and got his first regular role a year later voicing [Gai](https://anilist.co/character/13374/) in [Tenkuu Senki Shurato](https://anilist.co/anime/2113/).\n\nThough having voiced more characters in the medium than anyone else, he is probably most known for his role as [Dio Brando](https://anilist.co/character/4004/) in [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/14719/). He has stated that he likes playing villainous characters.\n\nKoyasu has taken over many of [Kaneto Shiozawa](https://anilist.co/staff/95424/)’s roles after Shiozawa’s passing.\n\nFather of [Kouki Koyasu](https://anilist.co/staff/219102/).\n\n__Non-Anime Roles:__\n\n- Olivert Reise Arnor - The Legend of Heroes Series (VG)\n- More - Metaphor: ReFantazio (VG)\n- Mustang - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)",
