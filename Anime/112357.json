Having joined the studio as one of its first employees, Góngora serves as the head of Science SARU's digital animation department and has specialized in the use of Adobe Animate.\n\nGóngora began his career in Europe, joining the Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon in 2006. He initially served as a location designer and later became an animator, working on the television series *\"Skunk Fu!\"* (2007–08). \n\nIn 2007, Góngora moved to the French animation studio Ankama, where he worked as an animator on the initial seasons of the company's Flash-animated series *\"Wakfu\"* (2008–12). During this time, Ankama opened a Japanese subsidiary, Ankama Japan, and Góngora was one of the animators who temporarily relocated to Tokyo, where he collaborated with director Masaaki Yuasa. \n\nAfter Ankama Japan closed in 2011, Góngora returned to the main Ankama studio in France. However, he remained in touch with Yuasa and his producer associate Eunyoung Choi, and following the foundation of Science SARU in 2013, joined the new company.",
