  "description": "Miharu is a very good girl, plagued by very bad luck! Her mother has died, leaving her only a single ring to remember her by, and her father's gone bankrupt – leaving her with all of his debts! Intending to sell the ring to pay off those debts and start a new life, Miharu crosses paths with Rintaro, a \"jewelry expert\" with more facets than the sharpest diamond. Alchemy, mysteries and gems both cursed and stolen all come together in this glittering series of comedy, horror and suspense!\n<br><br>\n(Source: Go! Comi)",

          "description": "Mick Takeuchi (竹内未来) is a Japanese manga artist, best known for her eleven-volume series Her Majesty's Dog, which has been translated into English by Go! Comi.  All eleven volumes of Her Majesty's Dog have now been published in English along with her two volume series \"A Wise Man Sleeps\".  Bound Beauty has been partially released (although Go!Comi hasn't released any new volumes for some time).    Takeuchi was a guest of honor at Anime Expo 2006 in Anaheim, California.    Ever since she was 13 years old, she knew she wanted to create manga. One of her influences is Rumiko Takahashi, in particular Takahashi's series Urusei Yatsura. To relax, she enjoys playing with her miniature schnauzers, Milky and Kentarō.   Although \"Miku\" is a traditional Japanese given name, \"Mick\" Takeuchi is actually named after Mick Jagger.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mick_lily/)",
