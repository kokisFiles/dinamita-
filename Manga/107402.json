          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ogata_kouji)\n\nBorn in 1970, a native of Osaka, Kouji Ogata spent his early twenties struggling to get enough credits to graduate from Osaka Design School. In late 1996, Ogata-sensei was commissioned by Media Works to illustrate the first Boogiepop novel, Boogiepop and Others.\n\nAt the time, Ogata-sensei was simply a rising star with a distinctive, eye-catching art style, but he was gradually able to further hone his artistic skills with each subsequent work. His watercolor-style paneling seen in the two-volume Boogiepop Doesn’t Laugh manga series was a particularly high point of his early career.\n\nIn addition to providing illustrations for novels and manga, Ogata-sensei has been involved with supplying character designs for anime productions including Boogiepop Phantom, Spirit, and Gin-iro no kami no Agito.\n\nIn his free time, he enjoys motorcycles, tennis, and remote-controlled models.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

Early the following year, the novel was released to widespread acclaim and ignited the Japanese “light novel” trend. Since that time, Kadono has written multiple Boogiepop novels and several related works such as Beat’s Discipline.\n\nIn addition to the Boogiepop universe, Kadono's body of literary work includes a wide array of fantasy and mystery novels such as Jiken, Soul Drop, Shizuru-san, and Night Watch series.",
