With his little brother tagging along, he and three friends from an online chat room gather and set out on a quest to find the treasure. What they discover instead is an entire underground community composed of assorted eccentrics, including a senile old soldier still performing a World War II-era mission.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

After having graduated high school in 1973, he left Miyagi, heading to Tokyo with the hopes of becoming a mangaka. He made his debut later on the same year with a manga adaptation of Prosper Mérimée's short novel Mateo Falcone, titled A Gun Report. In 1979, after writing multiple short-stories for the magazine Action, Ootomo created his first science-fiction work, titled Fireball. Although the manga was never completed, it is regarded as a milestone in Ootomo's career, containing many of the same themes he would later explore in [Doumu](https://anilist.co/manga/31215/), which began serialization in January 1980 and ran for two years until completed.\n\nIn 1982, Ootomo made his anime debut as character designer on [Harmagedon](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/). After this Ootomo began working on Akira, which would become his most acclaimed and famous work. The manga took eight years to complete and would eventually culminate in 2000 pages of artwork.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
