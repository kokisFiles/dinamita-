  "description": "Compilation recap movie for the series <i>Shin Seiki Evangelion.</i> Due to the struggling production of the movie 'End of Evangelion' delaying the film a month before it was set to release, this film was announced to 'hold fans over'.<br><br>\n\nDuring the early 21st century a meteorite crashed into Antarctica. After scientists went to study the crash a gigantic explosion followed, classified as the 'Second Impact'. Shinji Ikari is a fourteen year-old boy who has come to Toyko3, a city that also serves as a fortress, to meet up with his father who left him many years ago. The city also happens to be under siege by monstrous creatures called 'Angels' at the time of his arrival. Somehow Shinji finds himself in Evangelion Unit 01, and manages to synchronize with the giant robot. Shinji is told to become its permanent pilot, and is thrown into combat as the city's last defense for fighting off the angels. However, as Shinji fights, he begins to realize the truth behind the Angels, the Second Impact, man's struggle against God and what he truly is afraid of. <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)<br><br>\n\n<i>Note: Exists in several versions: (with most appearing on the Japanese 2015 Blu-ray Boxset)<br>\n• <b>Evangelion: DEATH & REBIRTH</b>, released theatrically on March 15, 1997 - 2-part feature, the first 2/3rds titled 'Death' consisting of a recap of the TV series with new/re-drawn animation added in, and the later 1/3rd titled 'Rebirth' consisting of the first 28 minute rough cut of End of Evangelion.<br>\n• <b>Death(True)</b>, aired on TV channel WOWOW on January 2, 1998 - re-edited version of 'Death' by director Masayuki, with most of the new animation cut (as it was moved to the \"Directors Cut\" of Episodes 21-24), but with some new shots added. Later released on the 'ARCHIVES OF EVANGELION' DVD Boxset.<br>\n• <b>Death(True)²</b>, released on March 7, 1998 - a further edited down version of Death(True), but with some new animation added. Regarded as this film's 'definitive' release, this is the version opted to be licensed by Netflix.<br>\n• <b>Revival of Evangelion</b>, released theatrically on March 8, 1998 - Theatrical double feature consisting of Death(True)² + 4 minute intermission + End of Evangelion.<br><br>\nFor simplicity's sake, we are only counting the first theatrical release in this entry.</i>",

Otsuka later named Sadamoto one of the three men more skillful than him.

He has been affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/) since its establishment.\n\nBorn in Tokyo and raised in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, he discovered his passion for anime during middle school, inspired by classics like [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/Galaxy-Express-999/) and [Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/). It was in high school that he met a like-minded friend with a love for drawing, sparking his aspiration to become an animator. During those formative years, he actively participated in the art club, where he honed his skills and embarked on creating independent anime projects.\n\nAfter graduating from the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he joined Studio Wombat as an in-between animator. During his time at the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he shared the same class with notable contemporaries such as [Mitsuru Obunai](https://anilist.co/staff/103077/Mitsuru-Obunai), [Yutaka Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/101801/Yutaka-Nakamura), and [Junichi Fujisaku](https://anilist.co/staff/100423/Junichi-Fujisaku). His journey took a significant turn in 1999 when he played a pivotal role in the establishment of [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/ufotable). Gathering with visionaries like [Hikaru Kondou](https://anilist.co/staff/103076/Hikaru-Kondou) in an old apartment in North Ikebukuro, Tokyo, they laid the foundation for what would become a renowned animation studio. In 2009, he made a significant move to the newly opened ufotable Tokushima Studio, where he assumed a leadership role, overseeing and nurturing a team primarily composed of young talents.\n\nOriginally harboring aspirations of becoming a director, he navigated a path from being an animator to realizing his dream. Armed with experiences in key animation and directing, he marked his directorial debut with \"Hanaukyo Maid Team: La Verite.\" Following his move to ufotable Tokushima Studio, he assumed the position of chief of the directing department, leaving his mark on numerous episodes. In his directorial role, he approached each project with careful consideration, assigning cuts to the Tokushima Studio staff thoughtfully, illustrating his dedication and meticulous approach to his craft.",
