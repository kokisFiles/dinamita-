In 1998, Suzumoto's novel Aoneko no Machi (青猫の街) tied in second in the tenth Japan Fantasy Novel Award competition. In 1999, Key released their first visual novel Kanon; the game had such an impact on Suzumoto that he entered Visual Art's, the publishing company Key is under, in February 2000 to work for Visual Art's as a scenario writer for brands under the company.    \n\nSuzumoto first worked on the scenario for Air, Key's second game released in 2000, and that same year worked as a scenario assistant for Mamahaha Chōkyō by Giant Panda. In 2001, Suzumoto again worked as a scenario assistant for Giant Panda for their game Shoyakenjō, and started work on Key's next game Clannad which was not released until 2004. Also in 2001, Suzumoto was employed as the scenario assistant for the game Sakura no Ki Shita de for the brand Words which was released in 2002, and that year he began work as the scenario assistant for Studio Mebius' Snow released in 2003. \n\nAlso in 2003, Suzumoto worked as the scenario assistant again for Giant Panda for their game Oshikake Princess released in 2004. After completing his work on Clannad, Suzumoto's last contribution to Key was as the scenario writer for Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume released in 2004. Suzumoto continued to work with brands under Visual Art's until September 2005 when he resigned from the company. Suzumoto wrote a style guide entitled Novel Game no Scenario Sakusei Gihō (ノベルゲームのシナリオ作成技法) published on July 24, 2006 by Shuwa System which describes how to write scenarios for visual novels. \n\nIn September 2006, Suzumoto entered the publishing company Aquaplus, known for being the parent company to Leaf. In December 2006, Suzumoto's first light novel Die Nachtjäger was published by SoftBank under their publishing label GA Bunko.",
