His animation favors expression above all else, to the point characters often bend out of shape when exposed to extreme forces and speeds. \n\nDespite this he still has a keen eye for delicate and realistic character animation, inspired by the likes of [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/Norio-Matsumoto), as demonstrated on both EDs for Birdy the Mighty Decode and [Shinsekai yori](https://anilist.co/anime/13125/From-the-New-World/) where he handled all aspects of the animation production. \n\nHe is also adept in post production work, often handling the photography, coloring and even CG in his own works.",
