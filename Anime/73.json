  "description": "This series is set about two months after the events ocurred in the Tuatha de Danaan at the end of the original series. Mithril becomes aware of a secret organization that has technology able to counter the ECS (Electronic Cloaking System) mode. This organization, known as Amalgam, also has \"Black Technology\", obtained from \"Whispered\" like Kaname Chidori, and like the other intelligency agencies, they intend to obtain more. However, when Sousuke's mission to protect Chidori is terminated by Mithril, all seems to be in place for Amalgam's plans... Like many of its fans know, it is based of the FMP novel \"The End of Day by Day.\"\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Infamous for his incendiary behavior on Twitter and for having been fired from [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) and [Ordet](https://anilist.co/studio/334/), the latter of which he helped co-found. \n\nAs a member of Kyoto Animation, he rose to prominence within the company after serving as assistant director on [Munto 2: Beyond the Walls of Time](https://anilist.co/anime/1135/). In 2006, he was selected to be the chief episode director of [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://anilist.co/anime/849/), after which he became well known among anime fans for the ending dance theme he choreographed. He was to make his full directorial debut with [Lucky Star](https://anilist.co/anime/1887/), but was replaced after four episodes due to \"performance issues.\" In a later radio interview, Yamamoto confirmed he was fired by Kyoto Animation and unsuccessfully attempted to win back his job. \n\nYamamoto has threatened to quit his career in anime production six times over the years. In May 2019, Yamamoto vowed never to \"work on anything related to animation again\" after finishing [Hakubo](https://anilist.co/anime/98784/). He has become notorious for his incendiary behavior on Twitter, including calling fans of anime \"mentally disabled,\" discriminatory remarks about Chinese and Korean anime fans, and attacking his former cast members, which resulted in him being temporarily suspended from Twitter in 2018.",

She worked at [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) from 2004 to 2020. \n\nYamada enjoyed drawing as a child and would copy images from the [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/) and [Dragon Ball](https://anilist.co/anime/223/) series. She joined the volleyball club in primary school and the tennis and photography clubs in high school. At the Kyoto University of Art and Design, she studied oil painting and was a member of the special effects club. She intended to work in film after university, but instead decided to join Kyoto Animation after seeing an advertisement. Her first assignment at the studio was drawing in between frames for [Inuyasha](https://anilist.co/anime/249/), which Kyoto Animation helped produce. She was eventually promoted to a key animator for [Air](https://anilist.co/anime/101/).\n\nAfter working as an episode director of [Clannad](https://anilist.co/anime/2167/), she was asked to make her chief directorial debut with [K-ON!](https://anilist.co/anime/5680/), an adaptation of a slice-of-life manga. The series was very successful, spurring a second season and a film. In 2013, she directed [Tamako Market](https://anilist.co/anime/16417/), and followed it with the film [Tamako Love Story](https://anilist.co/anime/20519/) in 2014. For Tamako Love Story, she was awarded the New Face Award at the Japan Media Arts Festival. She storyboarded the entire film herself, and also wrote the lyrics for the opening theme song, “Everybody Loves Somebody.”\n\nYamada's next project was the feature film [A Silent Voice](https://anilist.co/anime/20954/), an adaptation of [Yoshitoki Ooima](https://anilist.co/staff/105951/)’s manga by the same name. The film reflected on elements of bullying and physical impairment in Japan. The film opened at #2 in the Japanese Box Office and grossed a total of ¥2.3 billion (~$21.7m USD), the 19th highest-grossing film in Japan in 2016. The film also received multiple award nominations, including Best Animation Film in the Mainichi Film Awards and the Excellent Animation of the Year in the Japan Academy Prize.\n\nFor Yamada, the most important part of being a director is to observe people. She describes herself as a \"method\" director, emphasizing the minds of the characters.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
