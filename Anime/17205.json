          "description": "Kanno's earliest experiences with music came from attending church with her parents. She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

          "description": "A co-founder and a board member of [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/).\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Kawamoto was first employed in the making and designing of precision machinery. During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/). Some of the more recent works he has provided designs for include [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/), [Ghost Slayers Ayashi](https://anilist.co/anime/1587/), [Noragami](https://anilist.co/anime/20447/) and [Kekkai Sensen](https://anilist.co/anime/20727/).\n\n**Non-anime staff credits:**\n~!\n- Character Design - \"Gigantic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam A year of War\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91 Formula Senki 0122\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Return of Zion\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Senki\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE Be Eliminate Yesterday\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Wonder Project J\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Robot Alchemic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Assistant Chief Animation Director - \"OVER THE MONOCHROME RAINBOW\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation for \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam PERFECT ONE YEAR WAR\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Serial Experiments Lain\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Spiral Zone\" (ep 5)!~",
