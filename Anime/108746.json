  "description": "Stitch has been kidnapped from Lilo by a gang of space criminals who want to replicate Jumba's Experiment 626 research. However, a rival gang attacks their ship wanting Stitch for themselves, allowing him to break free and escape back to Earth in the confusion. Upon reentering Earth's atmosphere, he lands in China's Huangshan mountains where he meets a young local girl named Ai Ling and becomes part of her family. Unfortunately for Stitch, the two space gangs still want to take him, so he's going to need some help to ward them off.\n<br><br>\n(Source: TV Tropes)",
