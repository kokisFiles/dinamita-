Although at the beginning his songs exclusively featured Miku, he has recently begun using Rin and GUMI as well. He is well known for managing VOCALOIDs to perform shouts, screams and grunts through the use of filters and effects, and his melody generally has a heavy bass line. Aside from that, his lyrics often are somewhat complex and their hidden meaning is difficult to grasp at first glance.\n\n(Source: Vocaloid Wiki)",

          "description": "Utsu-P (鬱P, lit. Depression-P) is a recognized producer known for his Metal VOCALOID songs. Although at the beginning his songs exclusively featured Miku, he has recently begun using Rin and GUMI as well. He is well known for managing VOCALOIDs to perform shouts, screams and grunts through the use of filters and effects, and his melody generally has a heavy bass line. Aside from that, his lyrics often are somewhat complex and their hidden meaning is difficult to grasp at first glance.\n\n(Source: Vocaloid Wiki)",
