  "description": "One morning in the Tsukuda household, Hanpeita's sister, Tsukune, lets his pet bird escape out of spite. On the way home from school, she finds a strange egg from another planet and brings it home to give her brother, in order to make up for her earlier mistake. However, he isn't too pleased with it.<br>\n<br>\nNot too long after, the egg swells up, cracks its shell, and out comes a pink, strange chicken-like alien creature named Ganmo! He speaks like a human being and comes to live with the Tsukudas. Not wanting to be a mere freeloader, Ganmo takes the initiative to run errands, clean the house, and do other menial chores, yet he blunders at everything he does. Everytime Ganmo tries to clear his reputation his efforts end up causing even more confusion.<br>\n<br>\nA charming young, purple-haired girl named Ayumi Ichigaya moves next door to the Tsukudas. She has a strange pet myna bird named Déjà Vu. It's foppish with a poisonous tongue and always teases Ganmo for being so odd-looking.<br>\n<br>\nAnd so begin the messed up daily lives of young Hanpeita and his new pet.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time.
