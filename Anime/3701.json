  "description": "It is now possible to store memory data, so that the death of your body is not actually \"death\". As memories are stored in databanks, they can be \"transferred\" to new bodies. Because so-called \"memory trading\" now occurs, it is now possible to steal memories and illegally alter them.<br><br>\nSociety has fallen apart as authority has become lost and stagnant.<br><br>\nOne day, a man awakens in a ruined room. His name is Kaiba. He has no memories, but he does have a pendant with a picture of an unknown woman inside.<br><br>\nIn the skies are roiling clouds and electrical storms, impossible to pass without losing one's memories; above them lies the elusive realm of the rich and powerful, who barter others' bodies and memories for their own enjoyment and longevity. Below lies a troubled and dangerous world where good bodies are hard to come by and real money is scarce.<br><br>\nAfter suddenly being attacked, Kaiba escapes into space, and during his travels meets all sorts of people and regains his memories. Throughout it, he continues to be troubled by the world's problems, as well as his own existence. And what of the woman in the pendant, Neiro?",

          "description": "Akira Amemiya is an animator and up-and-coming director best known for directing [SSSS.GRIDMAN](https://anilist.co/anime/99424/SSSSGRIDMAN) and being Studio Trigger founder [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/Hiroyuki-Imaishi)'s protege. Amemiya's [animation and directing](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mini-imaishi.mp4) is very similar to Imaishi's yet is less chaotic and contains more 'retro' devices like impact frames and multi-tonal shading, drawing a lot of inspiration from [Masami Obari](https://anilist.co/staff/100660/Masami-Obari). For these reasons he was frequently typecasted for old school pose-heavy mecha combat.\n\nAmemiya is a nerdy director whose anime often heavily references other series and artists he loves, sometimes even replicating Obari's [animation sequences](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dangaioh2.mp4) and [layouts](https://i.imgur.com/nTRdM4K.jpg), [Transformer](https://twitter.com/SSS_SGRID/status/1051063114022572033)'s color designs, and Hideaki Anno's [establishing shots](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/welcome-to-the-anno-class.jpg) as well as long-lingering framing. Amemiya called Anno's [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/) his [favorite series before](https://i.imgur.com/nEYK186.png). Between his ode-heavy artistry he interjects personality with [subtle details](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/what-kind-of-brand-is-TOMATO-LIFE-tho.jpg), visual gags, and repurposing tonally contrasting homages into a different context.\n\nAmemiya graduated from Tokyo University of Technology and was part of the university's anime research society. During his time there he became heavily influenced by Osaka University's anime research club [Group CAS](https://twitter.com/group_cas). At the time [Toshiyuki Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/107357/Toshiyuki-Satou) was part of the group, while [Ikehata Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/120505/Ikehata-Hiroshi) visited regularly. After a bit of indie work Amemiya joined studio Gainax and climbed up the hierarchy: from clean-up to animation direction, onto storyboarding and episode directing, until after joining studio Trigger and co-directing Kill la Kill finally having the credentials to debut with his own series.\n\nHe is married to animator [Megumi Kouno](https://anilist.co/staff/120602/Megumi-Kouno).\n\n",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
