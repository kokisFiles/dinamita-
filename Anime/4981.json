          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/松本憲生)\n\nOriginating from Tatsunoko's animators training institute, where he met [Atsushi Wakabayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/105805/). Though primarily an action animator, he’s demonstrated impressive range elsewhere like in his scenes for [Haibane Renmei](https://anilist.co/anime/387/) and [Kaguya-hime](https://anilist.co/anime/16664/). He has the reputation of a fast and disciplined worker. [Toshiyuki Inoue](https://anilist.co/staff/103724/) said that he must have a “secret” for producing such a large volume of superb cuts.\n\nThough one of his earliest assignments was as an in-betweens checker for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/), his first major job was on [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), working under the director of the series, [Kazuhiro Furuhashi](https://anilist.co/staff/100655/). He would collaborate with Furuhashi again on Rurouni Kenshin, [You’re Under Arrest](https://anilist.co/anime/1577/), and [Hunter x Hunter](https://anilist.co/anime/136/). Around this time Matsumoto was also mentored by [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on [Irresponsible Captain Tylor](https://anilist.co/anime/569/).\n\nMatsumoto’s character animation is loose and full of smears, often looking like featureless masses in individual frames. He draws smoke without highlights, a tendency that earned the nickname “Norio smoke” and has been imitated by animators like [Shingo Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/114914/) and [Kenichi Kutsuna](https://anilist.co/staff/116007/). He occasionally storyboards his own scenes as he did for the 12th episode of [Birdy Decode:02](https://anilist.co/anime/5074/), the [third Naruto movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2144/), and episodes 31 & 85 of [Rurouni Kenshin](https://anilist.co/anime/45/). Prefers battles that take place in wide-open spaces with lots of forward momentum and background movement. Influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) and [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/), and has adapted elements of their approach for a wider audience.\n\nWhenever he serves as animation director on an episode, he does a lot of the key animation work himself. He also soloed the 7th episode of [Eat-Man](https://anilist.co/anime/1704/) and the [Kuragehime](https://anilist.co/anime/8129/) ED. He failed attempting to solo the 39th episode of You’re Under Arrest, and requested his name not be on the telop despite animating the vast majority of the episode.\n\nFamous for his work on the [Naruto](https://anilist.co/anime/20/) franchise, in which he often collaborated with Atsushi Wakabayashi.\n\nAs a well known animator with a wide network of connections, he regularly helps and receives help from his friends.\n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",

In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ushimou730) | [Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/馬越嘉彦)\n\nA highly prolific and respected character designer.\n\nOriginating from Monsieur Onion, where he spent his in-betweening days studying under [Hirotoshi Takaya](https://anilist.co/staff/117473/) and [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/). In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
