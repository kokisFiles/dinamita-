Upon arriving in the bizarre new world, Kaito discovers a cute little boy known as the \"navigator,\" which he names Nata. Everyone in Gamerz Heaven is out to capture Nata, and Kaito can only beat the game by saving him. This will be difficult for Kaito, as Gamerz Heaven is only a beta version with a limited number of saves. Kaito soon discovers in that everything that happens in Gamerz Heaven affects the real world, and characters that die in the game are wiped from the memories of everyone in his dimension. (ANN)",

          "description": "__Zodiac:__ Gemini\n__Circle:__ Crocodile Avenue (クロコダイル・アベニュー), writting under the pen name Gangstar Yoshio (ギャングスター吉雄)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/popo36226514) | [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/57382641)\n\nMaki Murakami made her manga debut in the 1995 April issue of Kimi to Boku. Her work was entitled Narushisuto No Higeki, roughly translated as 'The Tragedy of a Narcissist'. After a year, Maki Murakami began to publish a series, Gravitation, in Kimi to Boku. The manga was really loved by the public, but it abruptly ended with the closing of the magazine in 2000. By great demand from the fans, the manga was published solo, and in 2002 Gentosha picked it up. A sequel to the original 12-volume story began publishing in 2007 in webcomic form in the online magazine Genzo (Gentosha), and is called Gravitation EX.\nGravitation brought her her widest audience. Aside from the Gravitation manga, Maki Murakami is also the artist for all of the Gravitation Remixes, a doujinshi series that follows the \"further\" relationship between Yuki and Shuichi. Her doujinshi circle publishes various doujin especially for her series Gravitation.",
