  "description": "In a far away future, mankind lives underground in huge caves, unknowing of a world above with a sky and stars.<br><br>\nIn the small village of Jiha, Simon, a shy boy who works as a digger discovers a strange glowing object during excavation. The enterprising Kamina, a young man with a pair of rakish sunglasses and the passion of a firey sun, befriends Simon and forms a small band of brothers, the Gurren Brigade, to escape the village and break through the ceiling of the cave to reach the surface, which few believe exist.<br><br>\nThe village elder won't hear of such foolishness and punishes the Brigade. However, when disaster strikes from the world above and the entire village is in jeopardy, it's up to Simon, Kamina, a girl with a big gun named Yoko, and the small yet sturdy robot, Lagann, to save the day.<br><br>\nThe new friends journey to the world above and find that the surface is a harsh battlefield, and it's up to them to fight back against the rampaging Beastmen to turn the tide in the humans' favor! Pierce the heavens, Gurren Lagann!",

          "description": "[Twitter (shiimai)](https://twitter.com/shiimai) | [Sakugabooru](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=hiroyuki_imaishi+) \n\nHiroyuki Imaishi was born in 1971, in Tokyo. He joined studio Gainax after graduating from Tama University of Arts. Imaishi later left the studio to establish his own studio, Trigger, where he still works to this day.\n\nImaishi made a name for himself on *Hideaki Anno*'s [Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/). He did key animation and storyboards for several episodes, with episode 19 being a standout for its unorthodox paper cutout animation. His presence injected some stylized levity into Anno's shoujo drama.\n\nImaishi started as an animator heavily influenced by [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/Masahito-Yamashita) and [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada). He draws \nwith a similar warping of perspective and with characters snapping into discrete poses, mixed with cartoony devices reminiscent of A Pro's work on [Dokonjo Gaeru](https://anilist.co/anime/5618/Dokonjou-Gaeru/), of which Imaishi is a fan. He also tends to draw his characters enveloped in speedlines, with strongly defined eyes and eyebrows, rectangular jawlines, and gummy, gritted teeth. His cuts are willfully limited, eliminating transitions between poses and using fast looping for comedic effect.\n\nImaishi became one of Gainax' premier directors after Kare Kano. His directorial aesthetic is heavily informed by his animation. Elisions of graphic space become elisions of cinematic space and time.The interplay of moving and still planes, forceful use of text, and extreme variations in size are other major components of his direction. His shot compositions are usually very busy due to crunching in as much of his characters into the frame as possible, and he has no problem reducing action scenes to pure visual abstraction, like rendering clashing figures as a few pencil lines. He is known to employ [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki)-esque tricks like triple takes and postcard shots in his work. His storyboards are rough, improvised, and lacking in detail. He's a fan of American director [Robert Rodriguez](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/) and [John Woo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/), and loves referencing classic anime and film in his works.\n\nHis first solo directorial effort was the Production I.G. OVA [Dead Leaves](https://anilist.co/anime/974/Dead-Leaves/) which would set the stage for Imaishi's later works: crude, anarchic, and heterogeneous characters positioned against a homogenizing totalitarian force. Dead Leaves uses pillarboxing and text in a manner recalling stylized comic books. Imaishi served as character designer and animation director on the OVA so the animation is steeped in his neo-Kamada idiom more than any of his other works.\n\nImaishi left Gainax and formed studio Trigger with [Masahiko Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/Masahiko-Ootsuka) in 2011, bringing over several major animators to the new studio. His debut TV work with Trigger was 2013's [Kill la Kill](https://anilist.co/anime/18679/Kill-la-Kill/), that similarly to Gurren Lagann, freely and extensively referenced anime history. Despite being a broadly popular series overseas, it is Imaishi's most controversial work to date, not only for its extreme levels of fanservice, but also because it suffered damaging production problems: rewrites of the script, cost cutting animation shortcuts, and a restrictive schedule. \n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/hiroyuki-imaishi/)",

He quit music school as an elementary school student and, until his high school years, studied under Iwashita Tetsuya, who taught him how to use multiple recordings and synthesizers. He became a composer in his later high school years, through the various efforts made by himself and his teacher.\n\nIn 1985, he won a prize at the Kanagawa Arts Festival choral composition competition, while in the late 1980s, after entering Tokyo University of the Arts, he studied contemporary music under Satou Shin and Aoshima Hiroshi. While still being a student, he received the New Artist Award from the Japan Contemporary Music Association. He later started working as an arranger after graduating from college.\n\nIn 1999, he participated in the music unit \"Smart Drug\" with Koizumi Hiroshi, who was responsible for doing the composition and playing the guitar, and Okamoto Sayori who would later rename to Hiyoko, who was responsible for doing the lyrics and vocals. He participated under the alias \"Taque,\" where he was responsible for the arrangement and playing the keyboard. They released three CDs from 1999 to 2002.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

At the time he was very unexperienced with anime production and has [said](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he likely would have been fired for his lack of knowledge and poor quality work, if not for the in-between animation checker teaching him everything from scratch.\n\nLater down the line after establishing himself more in the anime industry, he would go on to work on \"[Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/Tengen-Toppa-Gurren-Lagann/)\" as a challenge to himself, where he would put forth mecha and effects animation he had no idea how to prior.\n\nKojima [states](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he feels a lot of inspiration from manga artists who are able to think about a story, break it up into panels, and express it in pictures. He has thought about drawing a manga himself, even if it's something simple.\n\nSome of his favorite anime are \"[Inital D](https://anilist.co/anime/185/Initial-D/),\" \"[Natsume's Book of Friends](https://anilist.co/anime/4081/Natsume-Yuujinchou/),\" \"[Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-](https://anilist.co/anime/21355/ReZero-kara-Hajimeru-Isekai-Seikatsu/),\" \"[Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Shin-Seiki-Evangelion/),\" \"[A KITE](https://anilist.co/anime/320/A-KITE/),\" \"[JIN-ROH](https://anilist.co/anime/570/JINROH/),\" \"[FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/)\" and \"[Doukyuusei -Classmates-](https://anilist.co/anime/21096/Doukyuusei/).\"\n\nSome of his favorite manga are \"[HI Score Girl](https://anilist.co/manga/74501/Hi-Score-Girl/)\" and \"[A White Rose in Bloom](https://anilist.co/manga/108360/Mejirobana-no-Saku/).\"\n",
