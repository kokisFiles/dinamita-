          "description": "KID, whose name is an acronym of Kindle Imagine Develop, was a Japan-based company specializing in porting and developing bishōjo games.    KID was founded in 1988, with the capital worth 160 million yen. In the early 1990s, it served primarily as a contract developer. Notable titles from this era include Burai Fighter, Low G Man, G.I. Joe, Isolated Warrior and Recca. In 1997, it began porting PC games on to video consoles. In 1999, it released its original title called Memories Off on PlayStation, which later became its first well-known series. In 2000, it released another original title called Infinity which became the second well-known series. This game was later renamed Never7 ~the end of infinity~ and Infinity became the series name. It has also created the popular underground PlayStation game Board Game Top Shop.    In 2005, KID became the sponsor for the Japanese drama series Densha Otoko.    According to Mainichi Shinbun, the company has declared bankruptcy in 2006. However in February 2007 it was announced that KID's intellectual properties had been acquired by the corporation Cyber Front, and thus all unfinished projects will be continued under the latter.",

She was also the winner of the \"Best Musical Performance\" award in the first Seiyuu Awards. She was also part of the quartet Prits alongside Yumiko Kobayashi, Natsuko Kuwatani, and Hisayo Mochizuki (all four voiced characters in the anime _Sister Princess_). Her singing style comes from singing Enka since she was young.\n\nIn July 2020, she married someone from the music industry, and they had their first child on March 16, 2021.\n\n__Non-Anime Roles:__\n- Ittasha in Bakuage Sentai Boonboomger",
