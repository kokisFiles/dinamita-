He is also affiliated with the <i>Dolce</i> 2D idol project.\n\nHe has a cute and girlish tenor voice, much like a kid's, and can be misheard as a female's. However, as heard in his cover of [Inokori Sensei](http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm28712230), he can sing in a lower tone as well. Rinu often uses autotune in his covers, making his voice a bit unclear; but in his cover of [Donor Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9nPMgp57ps), he was able to clearly sing several high notes. He is also a fan of adding small speaking parts into his covers, such as in his cover of [|||Toluthin Antenna|||](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7nhSCMc8z8).\n\n__Biography:__\nRinu started appearing in the utaite scene back in 2015, singing duet covers with [Youika](https://utaite.fandom.com/wiki/Youika). He eventually did his first solo cover in 2016 on the song [Net-game Haijin Sprechchor](http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm27953589). \n\nLater on, following certain events, he would come out on twitter on September 2nd, 2017 about being a [FTM transgender](https://twitter.com/differentoceans/status/1024511663528009728?s=19), while additionally sharing his thoughts and life experiences with gender dysphoria, transphobia and bullying up to this point. He has ultimately decided he has a gender identity disorder and that he is a man.\n\nHis most popular song as of October 12, 2019 is his cover of [Onegai Darling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAv0TcF1Gz4) with more than 14.3 million views combined (YouTube + Niconico).\n\nOther than making covers, Rinu often makes various skits and records gameplay with other members of his group, Strawberry Prince, which can be found on both his channel and the Strawberry Prince channel. Additionally, it can be assumed from the amount of covers that the two have done together, as well as the amount of gameplay videos and skits, that the member he is closest to is [Root](https://anilist.co/staff/181478/Root).",
