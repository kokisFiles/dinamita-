  "description": "In the year 2050 A.D, approximately 1/10th of Japan is now under water due to the global warming effect. The city of Tokyo was no exception.<br><br>\nThe economy of Japan is crippled from this disaster and the government is willing for anything to help revive the country. As a result, the Japanese government forms \"JESAS\", a military foundation that has evil intentions of controlling Japan's future. JESAS handles the dumping of nuclear wastes into outer space.<br><br>\nTo insure their protection from other countries, JESAS has developed \"R.B.\" Robotic Weaponry, which is controlled by pilots with \"A.I. (Accurate Intuition)\". On the opposite side of the law is the \"Green Frontier\", a united protection agency that was formed by countries sharing the same beliefs, to save the Earth.<br><br>\nFeaturing JESAS pilots Kanna and Kazuto and Green Frontier's Doota Kang and Mira Yu, these four youngsters will decide the fate of the Earth through love, friendship and the passion for their duty.<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

She was also the winner of the \"Best Musical Performance\" award in the first Seiyuu Awards. She was also part of the quartet Prits alongside Yumiko Kobayashi, Natsuko Kuwatani, and Hisayo Mochizuki (all four voiced characters in the anime _Sister Princess_). Her singing style comes from singing Enka since she was young.\n\nIn July 2020, she married someone from the music industry, and they had their first child on March 16, 2021.\n\n__Non-Anime Roles:__\n- Ittasha in Bakuage Sentai Boonboomger",
