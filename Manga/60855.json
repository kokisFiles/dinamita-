  "description": "Ever17 is the tale of seven individuals who come to be trapped within the underwater marine theme park, LeMU, 51 meters below the surface. During an apparently normal day at the park, an incident occurs, placing almost half of the facility underwater. The path to the surface and the communication lines are cut off. In addition, LeMU is under constant assault by severe water pressure, limiting time to find a means of escape to 119 hours. Escape is not the only concern, however; many questions arise as to the legitimacy of the accident and whether or not those trapped there were brought there for a purpose.<br>\nAs the situation grows more desperate, the people trapped inside LeMU grow closer. They begin to uncover the answers to mysteries about themselves, LeMU, and the situation itself. As the end of LeMU grows nearer, the mysteries and relationships forged by the situation grow deeper. Ultimately, it is up to the characters not only to survive, but to discover the truth behind LeMU and themselves as well.<br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "KID, whose name is an acronym of Kindle Imagine Develop, was a Japan-based company specializing in porting and developing bishōjo games.    KID was founded in 1988, with the capital worth 160 million yen. In the early 1990s, it served primarily as a contract developer. Notable titles from this era include Burai Fighter, Low G Man, G.I. Joe, Isolated Warrior and Recca. In 1997, it began porting PC games on to video consoles. In 1999, it released its original title called Memories Off on PlayStation, which later became its first well-known series. In 2000, it released another original title called Infinity which became the second well-known series. This game was later renamed Never7 ~the end of infinity~ and Infinity became the series name. It has also created the popular underground PlayStation game Board Game Top Shop.    In 2005, KID became the sponsor for the Japanese drama series Densha Otoko.    According to Mainichi Shinbun, the company has declared bankruptcy in 2006. However in February 2007 it was announced that KID's intellectual properties had been acquired by the corporation Cyber Front, and thus all unfinished projects will be continued under the latter.",
