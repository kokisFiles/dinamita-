The band first made headlines when they were chosen to play on the extremely selective \"ROOKIE A GO-GO\" stage at Japan's largest outdoor music festival, FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL. Singing in both low and high pitch, the extremely unique main vocal along with the band’s creative and eccentric performance made them the talk of the music scene before they were even debuted.\n\n__Biography:__\nThe band signed with the major record label, Sony Music Associated Records in 2011 by releasing their first debut album “Peacock.” They successfully drew attention to the music industry when their song “DESCO” was used as the theme song for “Moteki”, a highly rated movie in Japan. The band was also cast in the movie and had made their first appearance on the big screen. In 2012, the band released their 2nd album “Snake Princess.” Since then they have become active regulars at Japan’s major festivals, including repeated appearances at FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL, Summer Sonic and many more.\n\nIn 2013 the band went into a brief hiatus due to the departure of the guitarist because of health issue. The band came back in 2014 and released a full new album “Kirei.”\nIn 2016, main vocal AVU started a side project Gokumontoikka and released a smash hit split single “Kinsei/Shibou Yugi.\" Summer of 2016, the band performed overseas for the first time at “World Music Day” Festival in Paris.\n\nAfter releasing their 5th album “Q” in April 2017, the band kicked off to a sold-out national tour that included 15 shows. Later that year, the band performed in the musical production of “ROCKY HORROR SHOW (Jap ver.)” featuring AVU as one of the main cast. In 2018, QUEEN BEE released a new single “HALF” which is the theme song of the highly anticipated anime “Tokyo Ghoul：re“ that was premiered in Spring 2018.\n\nIn 2019, they released a new single “Fire” which is the theme song for the anime “Dororo” (created by Osamu Tezuka) that was premiered in January 2019. In March, the band made their first appearance at one of the most famous music festival in Taiwan, “MEGAPORT FESTVIAL 2019.” It was full house despite their first performance in Taiwan.\n\nIn May, the band released a brand new full album “Ten.” The lead track of the album “Holy war” is the theme song for the move “Sadako,” and “Introduction” is the theme song for the live-action movie \"Tokyo Ghoul【S】.\"\n\nCelebrating the band’s 10 year anniversary, QUEEN BEE will be kicking off a national tour with approximately 20,000 fans. In August, main vocal AVU was cast in the Japanese Broadway Musical “HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH” as Yitzhak.\n\n__Members:__\n- [Avu-chan](https://anilist.co/staff/124946/Avuchan) (otherwise known under her full pseudonym as Avu Barazono) - lead vocalist (2009-)\n- Yashi-chan (otherwise known under the full pseudonym as Yashi Akatorii) - bass guitarist (2009-)\n- Ruri-chan (otherwise known under the full pseudonym as Ruri Nijigamine) - drummer (2009-2023)\n- Hibari-kun - lead guitarist (2015-)\n\n__Former Members:__\n- Yuuki-chan - lead guitarist (2009)\n- Gigi-chan (otherwise known under the full pseudonym Gigi Yurijou) - lead guitarist (2009-2012)\n\n<i>(All band members are known to use pseudonyms instead of their real names, as such not much information is known about their real identity)</i>\n\n(Source: [Ziyoou-vachi's Official Website](https://www.ziyoou-vachi.com/about/index_e.html), edited)",

Subsequently, the group released a number of albums such as U.F.O. (1991), Karateka (1992), Vitamin (1993), Dragon (1994), Orange (1996), A (1997), and Voxxx (2000). The group's 1997 single, \"Shangri-La\", has sold more than half a million copies. The group took a hiatus between 2001 and 2004.\n\nIn 2019, Pierre Taki was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession. In response, Sony Music Entertainment Japan took Denki Groove's recordings off the shelves and stopped streaming the group's music. Streaming services were resumed on June 19 2020.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
