          "description": "A prominent director and a key member of [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/).\n\nAfter graduating from Osaka Designers' College in the late '80s, Ishihara joined Kyoto Animation and began his career as an animator. In 1991, he made his debut as a director with [Shiawasette Naani](https://anilist.co/anime/13441/). After that, he switched his focus to directing. Back then Kyoto Animation was still a sub-contracting studio, so therefore Ishihara could only get a handful of opportunities directing. Some of the shows in which Ishihara got to direct multiple episodes were [Tenchi Muyou!](https://anilist.co/anime/696/), [Aka-chan to Boku](https://anilist.co/anime/1485/), [Hyper Police](https://anilist.co/anime/1180/), and [Inuyasha](https://anilist.co/anime/249/). He also storyboarded the majority of the episodes he directed.\n\nIn 2003, Kyoto Animation started their transformation into a full-fledged animation studio producing their first anime series, [Fullmetal Panic? Fumoffu](https://anilist.co/anime/72/). Ishihara directed and storyboarded the 7th episode of the show. Two years later in 2005, he made his proper directorial debut directing the studio's second TV show, [Air](https://anilist.co/anime/101/). The following year he directed the award winning anime series, [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://anilist.co/anime/849/). From here Ishihara has gone on to direct multiple of Kyoto Animation's acclaimed works.",

He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work.
