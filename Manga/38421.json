  "description": "Kokoro was involved in a traffic accident when she was small, and there was a hero who risked his life to save her. She can't remember anything about him, except for his back, which was scarred from saving her. Now a high school student, she still can't forget the guy from her memories. Suddenly, she was assigned to take care of the new transfer student, Inuyama Kei, who's always quiet and somewhat of a weirdo. He reminds her of her childhood hero, but she wishes her hero was Shun-senpai, the idol of all the girls in school, and who's been very nice to her lately... (Source: Aerandria)",
