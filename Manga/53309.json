But is he a diamond in the rough, or just a bully?\n",

Nagayasu remained in the shadows of his master for many years, until he met Otomo Katsuhiro, who wrote a scenario for him. Together they made 'Mother Sarah', the series about a mother searching for her children in a postnuclear world, which was published in several other countries.
