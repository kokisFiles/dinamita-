  "description": "<i>Nichijou</i> primarily focuses on the daily antics of a trio of childhood friends—high school girls Mio Naganohara, Yuuko Aioi and Mai Minakami—whose stories soon intertwine with the young genius Hakase Shinonome, her robot caretaker Nano, and their talking cat Sakamoto. With every passing day, the lives of these six, as well as of the many people around them, experience both the calms of normal life and the insanity of the absurd. Walking to school, being bitten by a talking crow, spending time with friends, and watching the principal suplex a deer: they are all in a day's work in the extraordinary everyday lives of those in <i>Nichijou</i>. <br>\n<br>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He worked as a typesetter before becoming a manga artist. At 19, he started drawing short stories for Media Factory's Comic Flapper, the most notable being his first series KazeMachi, which ran from January to March 2006. By that time, Kadokawa Publishing took notice of him and he began to work on Nichijou, which won Kadokawa's 22nd ACE Award for New Artists. Nichijou thus began its run in November 2006 under Kadokawa's flagship magazine Shonen Ace, and ended its run in October 2015.\n\nHe then went on to work on City, which began its run in September 2016 under Kodansha's Morning magazine.",

She joined the volleyball club in primary school and the tennis and photography clubs in high school. At the Kyoto University of Art and Design, she studied oil painting and was a member of the special effects club. She intended to work in film after university, but instead decided to join Kyoto Animation after seeing an advertisement.

The series was very successful, spurring a second season and a film. In 2013, she directed [Tamako Market](https://anilist.co/anime/16417/), and followed it with the film [Tamako Love Story](https://anilist.co/anime/20519/) in 2014.

The film reflected on elements of bullying and physical impairment in Japan. The film opened at #2 in the Japanese Box Office and grossed a total of ¥2.3 billion (~$21.7m USD), the 19th highest-grossing film in Japan in 2016. The film also received multiple award nominations, including Best Animation Film in the Mainichi Film Awards and the Excellent Animation of the Year in the Japan Academy Prize.\n\nFor Yamada, the most important part of being a director is to observe people.
