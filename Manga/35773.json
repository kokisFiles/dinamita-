  "description": "1) Let's Make Love!! (Make Love Shiyo!!). (v01 ch1 to 6) Mari Nishimiya is a high school junior who's tired of playing it safe. Less concerned with her summer session and more with achieving the love of a lifetime, she ventures to a foreigners' pub with her childhood friend, Yuuta. There, she meets Leon Gardner, an American dancer with a talented tongue (...meaning, he's bilingual)! While Yuuta disapproves, having an unrequited love for Mari himself, he and other enemies of this international relationship may be powerless to stop it when Leon joins Mari's class as... (!!!)<br><br>\nLet's Make More Love!! (Motto Make Love Shiyo!! ). (v02 ch7). Mari wants to have an adult Christmas with Leon. Why is Leon so set against it?<br><br>\nLet's Always Make Love!! (Zutto Make Love Shiyo!! ). (v02 ch8). Attending the international wedding of Leon's friend, Randy, has Mari thinking in a new way about her future. But when Mari begins to feel strangely sick and misses her period, the circumstance forces her to make an early decision! But Leon suddenly has to leave for America!? Why?? Mari isn't going to like the reason Randy gives her...<br><br>\n2) I Don't Need Any Scenario! (Shinario Nante Iranai! ). (v02 ch9). This ground-breaking short story was Shinjo Mayu's first work to contain a provocative sex scene and to mark her as a pornographer! Read the freetalk to learn more! Yuuya is the manager of the drama club, and he's very strict and exacting about how the student thespians handle their roles. Chiharu is supposed to be playing a woman in love, but there's no emotion in her performance! So it's handsome Yuuya's job to teach her how to long for a man... Was this scenario in the script!?<br><br>\n3) I Want to Be Painted with Your Color (Anata no Iro ni Somaritai). (v02 ch10). This short story is Shinjo Mayu's debut work. Kazumi Inoue wants to be transformed by the magic of a white wedding dress, and then painted in a man's color. The biggest delinquent in school, Kazuya Sakurai, wasn't who she had in mind, though! He's intent on painting her a different color -- why? Kazumi will have her wish - a transformation through the magic of a wedding dress - but not in a way that anyone expects!\n",

Her works range from sweet and innocent to almost borderline-H. She loves big-chested girls with cute faces and wishes all her manga could feature them. She says that she relies deeply on her assistants, calls herself a trend whore, loves scandalous things, considers herself a foreigner otaku and a Disney maniac, likes to drink, and is in love with video/audio.\n\nShe left Shogakukan in 2007 because of alleged abuse from her editors and now works for Kadokawa and Shueisha.\n\nShinjo has stated in an interview that she most likely will not be writing shoujo manga again, and hereon create only BL manga or bishounen manga. The MC characters should be only males.",
