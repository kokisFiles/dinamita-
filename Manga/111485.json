  "description": "During the Chen dynasty, Consort Jing gave birth to a pair of fraternal twins under the rays of sunlight. The prince was born with a cinnabar mole between his eyebrows, while the princess was born with six fingers. Fortune and misfortune appeared at the same time, causing the twins to experience entirely different fates as they were forced to leave their family. The heavenly tribulation is approaching, will the two twins who were separated from birth ever get to be reunited? What methods would they use to fight against their destinies?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Bilibili Comics) ",

She is best known for creating the comics Zi Bu Yu and Chang Ge Xing, and five million copies of her works have been sold as of 2018. Her art has been noted for its classical style, and have been met with positive reception in both China and Japan. In 2008, she won the Gold Prize in the girls’ category of the fiction section, the Fifth OACC Golden Dragon Award Original Animation & Comic Competition, the biggest one in China of its kind.\n\nHer interests had included painting and comic-reading since she was a child, and she was eventually inspired to make her own comics in high school. She published her first work, titled Cheng Zhang, in the Beijing Cartoon magazine, receiving an encouraging, handwritten reply by her editorial teacher. After graduating from university, she moved to Beijing and briefly worked in advertising before quitting to focus on her own comics. During this time, she became engrossed in drawing, seldom leaving her apartment as she lived on a modest income.",
