In another world, a young girl, blue fire residing in her eyes, Black Rock Shooter faces another young girl; this one holding a jet-black scythe, Dead Master, and a battle to the death begins to unfold.<br><br>\n(Source: The Official Black Rock Shooter Site) ",

He graduated from the Faculty of Law in Kwansei Gakuin University. After graduating from university, he became a manager at a women's clothing store but decided to quit to pursue a writing career.\n\nHe would spend time being unemployed and reading books at the library, until he made his debut in March 2003 with his novel \"Dengeki!! Aegis 5\" in the magazine \"Dengeki Moeou\". That same year, two of his other novels [Escape From School!](https://anilist.co/manga/40275/Gakkou-wo-Deyou/) and [The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi](https://anilist.co/manga/33083/Suzumiya-Haruhi-Series/) were released, with The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi winning the Sneaker Taisho literary prize.\n\nHis work is strongly influenced by the science fiction novels he read while in middle school. He has mentioned that authors who influenced him in particular were [Hideyuki Kikuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97323/Hideyuki-Kikuchi/), [Baku Yumemakura](https://anilist.co/staff/97026/Baku-Yumemakura/), [Ellery Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellery_Queen), [Van Dine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._S._Van_Dine), [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov), as well as the director of [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/Urusei-Yatsura/), [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/Mamoru-Oshii/).",

Infamous for his incendiary behavior on Twitter and for having been fired from [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) and [Ordet](https://anilist.co/studio/334/), the latter of which he helped co-found. \n\nAs a member of Kyoto Animation, he rose to prominence within the company after serving as assistant director on [Munto 2: Beyond the Walls of Time](https://anilist.co/anime/1135/). In 2006, he was selected to be the chief episode director of [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://anilist.co/anime/849/), after which he became well known among anime fans for the ending dance theme he choreographed. He was to make his full directorial debut with [Lucky Star](https://anilist.co/anime/1887/), but was replaced after four episodes due to \"performance issues.\" In a later radio interview, Yamamoto confirmed he was fired by Kyoto Animation and unsuccessfully attempted to win back his job. \n\nYamamoto has threatened to quit his career in anime production six times over the years. In May 2019, Yamamoto vowed never to \"work on anything related to animation again\" after finishing [Hakubo](https://anilist.co/anime/98784/). He has become notorious for his incendiary behavior on Twitter, including calling fans of anime \"mentally disabled,\" discriminatory remarks about Chinese and Korean anime fans, and attacking his former cast members, which resulted in him being temporarily suspended from Twitter in 2018.",

Infamous for his incendiary behavior on Twitter and for having been fired from [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) and [Ordet](https://anilist.co/studio/334/), the latter of which he helped co-found. \n\nAs a member of Kyoto Animation, he rose to prominence within the company after serving as assistant director on [Munto 2: Beyond the Walls of Time](https://anilist.co/anime/1135/). In 2006, he was selected to be the chief episode director of [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://anilist.co/anime/849/), after which he became well known among anime fans for the ending dance theme he choreographed. He was to make his full directorial debut with [Lucky Star](https://anilist.co/anime/1887/), but was replaced after four episodes due to \"performance issues.\" In a later radio interview, Yamamoto confirmed he was fired by Kyoto Animation and unsuccessfully attempted to win back his job. \n\nYamamoto has threatened to quit his career in anime production six times over the years. In May 2019, Yamamoto vowed never to \"work on anything related to animation again\" after finishing [Hakubo](https://anilist.co/anime/98784/). He has become notorious for his incendiary behavior on Twitter, including calling fans of anime \"mentally disabled,\" discriminatory remarks about Chinese and Korean anime fans, and attacking his former cast members, which resulted in him being temporarily suspended from Twitter in 2018.",
