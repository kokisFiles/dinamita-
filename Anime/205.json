  "description": "Let's break it down. Mugen's a reckless sword-slinger with a style that's more b-boy than Shaolin. He's got a nasty streak that makes people want to stick a knife in his throat. Then there's Jin, a deadbeat ronin who speaks softly but carries a big blade. He runs game old-school style, but he can make your blood spray with the quickness. When these roughnecks bring the ruckus, it ain't good for anybody, especially them. Enter Fuu, the ditzy waitress who springs her new friends from a deadly jam. All she wants in return is help solving a riddle from her past. She and the boys are tracking the scent, but there's 99 ways to die between them and the sunflower samurai.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Funimation)",

          "description": "[Twitter (shiimai)](https://twitter.com/shiimai) | [Sakugabooru](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=hiroyuki_imaishi+) \n\nHiroyuki Imaishi was born in 1971, in Tokyo. He joined studio Gainax after graduating from Tama University of Arts. Imaishi later left the studio to establish his own studio, Trigger, where he still works to this day.\n\nImaishi made a name for himself on *Hideaki Anno*'s [Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/). He did key animation and storyboards for several episodes, with episode 19 being a standout for its unorthodox paper cutout animation. His presence injected some stylized levity into Anno's shoujo drama.\n\nImaishi started as an animator heavily influenced by [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/Masahito-Yamashita) and [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada). He draws \nwith a similar warping of perspective and with characters snapping into discrete poses, mixed with cartoony devices reminiscent of A Pro's work on [Dokonjo Gaeru](https://anilist.co/anime/5618/Dokonjou-Gaeru/), of which Imaishi is a fan. He also tends to draw his characters enveloped in speedlines, with strongly defined eyes and eyebrows, rectangular jawlines, and gummy, gritted teeth. His cuts are willfully limited, eliminating transitions between poses and using fast looping for comedic effect.\n\nImaishi became one of Gainax' premier directors after Kare Kano. His directorial aesthetic is heavily informed by his animation. Elisions of graphic space become elisions of cinematic space and time.The interplay of moving and still planes, forceful use of text, and extreme variations in size are other major components of his direction. His shot compositions are usually very busy due to crunching in as much of his characters into the frame as possible, and he has no problem reducing action scenes to pure visual abstraction, like rendering clashing figures as a few pencil lines. He is known to employ [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki)-esque tricks like triple takes and postcard shots in his work. His storyboards are rough, improvised, and lacking in detail. He's a fan of American director [Robert Rodriguez](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/) and [John Woo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/), and loves referencing classic anime and film in his works.\n\nHis first solo directorial effort was the Production I.G. OVA [Dead Leaves](https://anilist.co/anime/974/Dead-Leaves/) which would set the stage for Imaishi's later works: crude, anarchic, and heterogeneous characters positioned against a homogenizing totalitarian force. Dead Leaves uses pillarboxing and text in a manner recalling stylized comic books. Imaishi served as character designer and animation director on the OVA so the animation is steeped in his neo-Kamada idiom more than any of his other works.\n\nImaishi left Gainax and formed studio Trigger with [Masahiko Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/Masahiko-Ootsuka) in 2011, bringing over several major animators to the new studio. His debut TV work with Trigger was 2013's [Kill la Kill](https://anilist.co/anime/18679/Kill-la-Kill/), that similarly to Gurren Lagann, freely and extensively referenced anime history. Despite being a broadly popular series overseas, it is Imaishi's most controversial work to date, not only for its extreme levels of fanservice, but also because it suffered damaging production problems: rewrites of the script, cost cutting animation shortcuts, and a restrictive schedule. \n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/hiroyuki-imaishi/)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hosodamamoru)\n\nHosoda initially felt inspired to take up animation as a career after seeing [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/), the first film directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). He majored in oil painting at the Kanazawa College of Art in Ishikawa Prefecture. After graduation, Hosoda was able to land an animation job at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/), after submitting a short film that he had animated in his spare time. He initially applied at [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/); though he did not get the job, he received a rejection letter of praise from Hayao Miyazaki himself.\n\nDuring his time at Toei, Hosoda worked his way up, garnering public attention in the early 2000s with the first two films in the Digimon series. It was his first co-directed film, [Digimon: The Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2961/), which attracted the eye of Ghibli head producer [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/).\n\nStudio Ghibli announced that Hosoda was to direct the film [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/) in September 2001. This was scheduled for a summer 2003 release. However, production on the film became strained due to creative differences. According to Hosoda, he \"was told to make the movie similar to how Miyazaki would have made it, but he wanted to make his own film the way he wanted to make it\". In the end, Hosoda left in the summer of 2002 during the early production stages, after failing to come up with a concept acceptable to Studio Ghibli bosses.\n\nProceeding his departure from Ghibli, Hosoda returned to Toei and worked on a few animations in collaboration with artist Takashi Murakami, such as the commercial Superflat Monogram for Louis Vuitton. During this time, he directed an episode of [Ojamajo Doremi](https://anilist.co/anime/353/), which was inspired by his turbulent time at Ghibli. This episode led to him being hired at the animation studio [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), which he worked at from 2005 to 2011.\n\nAt Madhouse, Hosoda earned critical acclaim with his directing efforts. His two movies, [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/) and [Summer Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/5681/), both won the Japan Academy Film Prize award.\n\nIn 2011, Hosoda left Madhouse to establish his own animation studio, [Studio Chizu](https://anilist.co/studio/555/), with Yuuichirou Saitou who produced both previously mentioned award winning shows. As of August 2020, Studio Chizu has released three films directed by Hosoda: 2012's [Wolf Children](https://anilist.co/anime/12355/), 2015's [The Boy and the Beast](https://anilist.co/anime/20981/), and 2018's [Mirai](https://anilist.co/anime/100749/). Which of Mirai was nominated for Best Animated Feature for the 2019 Oscars.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n__Notable Awards:__\n\n- **The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2007)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2007)\n\\- Winner, Best Animation of the Year (Japan Academy Film Prize 2007)\n\n- **Summer Wars**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Original Story (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Notable Entry (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Animation of the Year (Japan Academy Film Prize 2010)\n\n- **Wolf Children**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Best Screenplay (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Notable Entry (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\n- **Mirai**\n\\- Nominee, Best Animated Feature Film (Academy Awards, USA)\n\n(Source: IMDb)",

Also unlike most animators at the time, Nakazawa wasn't really that shaped by [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s style, he was though, a huge fan of [Ichirou Itano](https://anilist.co/staff/103268/)'s and [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s.\n\nIn 2002, Nakazawa made his directorial debut with Comedy, part of an anthology titled [Sweat Punch](https://anilist.co/anime/1072/), produced by [Studio 4°C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/). The following year he directed both [Parasite Dolls](https://anilist.co/anime/1350/) jointly with [Naoyuki Yoshinaga](https://anilist.co/staff/115038/), as well as the animated part in Quentin Tarantino's movie, Kill Bill: Volume 1. This brought him a lot of international praise. He then got reached out to by director [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) of [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/) fame, about the possiblity of taking part in the director's next work, [Samurai Champloo](https://anilist.co/anime/205/). Nakazawa accepted the offer and ended up being a crucial part of its production, handling the character designs and serving as the sole chief animation director on the show. He also directed, storyboarded and wrote the 15th episode. Ten years later in 2014, Nakazawa collaborated with Watanabe for the second time on [Terror in Resonance](https://anilist.co/anime/20661/), providing the character designs and working as an animation director on the series.\n\nIn recent years he has been closely involved with [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/).",
