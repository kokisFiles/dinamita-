  "description": "In the Sengoku period, a rounin called Nanashi (meaning nameless) saves a young boy Kotarou and his dog Tobimaru at an abandoned temple. Kotarou has no family, is pursued by a mysterious militia organization from China, and hires Nanashi as his bodyguard. Among the pursuers is a man called Rarou, a very skilled warrior with blond hair and blue eyes. He obeys an old man called Byakuran and is a member of the Chinese militia. Unlike his companions in the militia, he is not serving any Emperor and just wants to fight with the strong.",

After switching several studios; from Art Office Sharaku, to Anime Torotoro, to [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), he eventually settled at [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/) with a contract.\n\nNakamura is considered to be among the best action animators, with his scenes featuring catchy movement and effects. Some of his recognizable traits include camera shaking, blurs, and bending and stretching high-speed objects. His fights are praised for its weighty, intense choreographies that are heavy on impact frames. His signature trait is drawing debris as simple cubes, consequentially named \"Yutapon Cubes,\" which are stylistic and easy to draw. Despite being responsible for popularizing it, Nakamura has stated that he started doing it when he noticed [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) doing it. \n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",
