In 1996, while in college, Ubukata won the first Sneaker Taisho Gold Prize for his light novel Kuroi Kisetsu, and thus debuted as a writer. In 2003, he won the Nihon SF Taisho Award for Mardock Scramble, originally published as a three-volume series. He is involved in a wide range of projects including anime production for Fafner, video game production, and original content writing for comics such as Le Chevalier D'Eon. His other works include the Bye-Bye Earth and Spiegel novel series. In 2009, he published his first historical novel, Tenchi Meisatsu, focusing on a mathematician of the Edo period. ",
