          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/masaakiyuasa)\n\nAn acclaimed anime director known for his wild, freeform style. \n\nAfter graduating from the Kyushu Sangyo University's Faculty of Arts in 1987 he joined studio [Ajia-do](https://anilist.co/studio/30/Ajiado), initially as in-betweener but rapidly moving to key animation. \n\nIn the first part of his career Yuasa established himself as an idiosyncratic creator while working on several child friendly anime, such as [Chibi Maruko-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/951/Chibi-Marukochan/) and [Doraemon](https://anilist.co/anime/2677/Doraemon-Nobitas-Animal-Planet/), but especially on [Crayon Shin-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/966/Shin-Chan/), a project he was involved with for most of the '90s. \n\nOne of his breakthrough roles in this period was his participation on the second part of [The Hakkenden](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/The-Hakkenden-Legend-of-the-Dog-Warriors-Part-2/), working as animation director under [Shinya Oohira](https://anilist.co/staff/103893/Shinya-Oohira)'s direction. This OVA was an important outing of the '90s, uniting many veteran artists and talented newcomers. \n\nHe debuted as director on [Mind Game](https://anilist.co/anime/875/Mind-Game/), an abstract piece combining animation and live-action footage, winning the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival (overcoming even Hayao Miyazaki's [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/)), and earning [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/Yoshiyuki-Tomino)'s praise, who acted as the chief judge. After Mind Game Yuasa spent several years at [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE) working on various projects. In 2013, he founded [Science SARU](https://anilist.co/studio/6145/Science-SARU) alongside his close affiliate [Eun-Yeong Choi](https://anilist.co/staff/115088/EunYeong-Choi).\n\nOn March 25, 2020 it was announced Yuasa stepped down as the CEO of Science SARU. He would work there as director until the completion of his latest Movie, [Inu-Oh](https://anilist.co/anime/109928/InuOh/), and would later cease any affiliation with the studio.\n\nOn February 17, 2025 it was announced that Yuasa would launch of his own animation studio, ame pippin. Their debut project would be the film [Daisy's Life](https://anilist.co/anime/190574/Hinagiku-no-Jinsei/).",

He belongs to the J-pop group GENERATIONS from EXILE TRIBE under the talent agency LDH JAPAN.\n\nHaving music teachers as both his grandfather and father, he grew up playing the piano. He performed mostly as an accompanist at choir contests, and didn't have any thought of becoming an entertainer. But after being fascinated by the performance of the well-known J-pop group EXILE in a live concert that his mother invited him to, he considered the idea for the first time. Spurred on by his penchant for singing and compliments for it at karaoke, he decided to go for it in high school. His budding dream of becoming an artist grew slowly as he was further inspired by the passionate fellow auditionees, and the words of EXILE's vocalist ATSUSHI to him. So despite not being selected after reaching the final of a major vocal audition, he seriously began taking lessons with scholarship at EXPG — a school of performing arts from LDH. A year later he became a candidate member of the group GENERATIONS, and another year later, in 2012, he made his debut with the group as an official member.\n\nBesides his position as mainly a vocalist and also a performer (dancer), he wrote lyrics for his group a few times as well. Additionally, he's quite active as a model and actor. The protagonist's role in the live-action adaptation of the manga \"Ani ni Aisaresugite Komattemasu\" earned him a breakthrough in his career. Since then, he has acted in several J-dramas and movies, including \"Gozen 0-ji, Kiss Shi ni Kite yo\" — a live-action adaptation of another manga. In 2019, he did his debut voice acting for the protagonist Minato Hinageshi from the anime movie \"Kimi to, Nami ni Noretara.\" He also sang the movie's theme song Brand New Story as one of the vocalists of GENERATIONS. As of September 2021, he has released two solo singles as a part of shows he starred in.\n\nRyota is the first Japanese male celebrity to be selected by Variety as one of the most promising stars of Asia's next generation, winning one of the \"8 Asian Stars: Up Next\" awards at Macao's 4th International Film Festival & Awards. He also attained the Popular Artist Award at WEIBO Account Festival in Japan 2018, which became a testament of his vast popularity in China alongside his homeland.",
