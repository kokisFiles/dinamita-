          "description": "__Age:__ 16\n__Height:__ 158 cm (5'2\")\n<br>\nThe first Japanese VOCALOID to be both developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media, Inc.. She was initially released in August 2007 for the VOCALOID2 engine and was the first member of the Character Vocal Series, as well as the seventh VOCALOID overall and the second VOCALOID2 vocal released to be released for the engine. Her voice is provided by the Japanese voice actress [Saki Fujita](https://anilist.co/staff/95504/Saki-Fujita).\n\nThere have since been numerous installments, such as additional voice libraries dubbed 'Append', as well as an upgrade for the VOCALOID3 engine, which contained an English vocal release. She received a VOCALOID4 update to her Japanese and English voicebanks in August 2016, as well as a Mandarin Chinese voicebank in September 2017.\n\nMiku is considered the most popular and well known Vocaloid and the first to become a pop idol. The name of the title and the character of the software were chosen by combining Hatsu (初, first), Ne (音, sound), and Miku (未来, future) thus meaning \"the first sound from the future.\" Her name was based on her concept of that when a sound is first spoken.\n\nWhen KEI illustrated Miku, he was given a color scheme to work with (based on the YAMAHA synthesizers' signature blue-green colour) and was asked to draw Miku as an android. Crypton also provided KEI with Miku's detailed concepts, however, Crypton said it was not easy to explain what a \"Vocaloid\" was to him. KEI said he could not create an image of a \"singing computer\" at first, as he did not even know what a \"synthesizer\" was. It took him more than a month to complete the commission. ",

Later on, when he discovered the now famous video uploading site Nico Nico Douga, he would start posting videos there himself. This would start in 2008, and he would upload mainly VOCALOID-type music meshed with loud rock colors. He gained immense popularity on the site and was even entered into the Nico Nico Douga hall of fame. He was particularly interested in a song titled \"Hope\", but because his lyrics made his feelings popular, he began to write lyrics that were far from fiction and closer to reality. This, he said, described himself.\n\nHe would later make a major debut on the album \"Story of Hope\", which would come ou on September 26 of 2012. Later on January 16 of 2013, the album \"Wall in the presence -Yuppeism edition-\" was released on the iTunes Store. Even later on July 16 of 2014, the album \"Bokaro Holic\" was released. While participating in the making of all of these albums, he was also in-charge of the vocals in the band My Eggplant Died Yesterday, though the band suspended in July of 2014. From this suspension, a new band would form, titled \"GRILLED MEAT YOUNGMANS\".\n\nYuyoyuppe has also been involved in the production of BABYMETAL's songs \"ウ・キ・ウ・キ★ミッドナイト (Uki Uki ☆ Midnight)\", \"BABYMETAL DEATH\", \"メギツネ (Megitsune)\", etc. He has also performed extensively, appearing at the ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL and at the SUMMER SONIC, under the name \"DJ'TEKINA//SOMETHING\".\n\n(Source: [Wikipedia (Yuyoyuppe)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%86%E3%82%88%E3%82%86%E3%81%A3%E3%81%BA), edited)",
