  "description": "Chiko is a high school student who can see other people&rsquo;s red threads, or the thread that connects one person to his or her soulmate. She uses her ability as a musubi-ya to advice schoolmates on their lovelives, for a fee of course! But upon stumbling upon a hidden room at her school, she sees a mysterious looking white spool of thread that suddenly comes alive and traps her. The next thing she knew, her body has become like a ten-year old kid again and the only way to get back her body is to use the mysterious thread to expel evil spirits and become a real musubi-ya!<br><br>\n[aerendria]",

All eleven volumes of Her Majesty's Dog have now been published in English along with her two volume series \"A Wise Man Sleeps\".  Bound Beauty has been partially released (although Go!Comi hasn't released any new volumes for some time).    Takeuchi was a guest of honor at Anime Expo 2006 in Anaheim, California.    Ever since she was 13 years old, she knew she wanted to create manga. One of her influences is Rumiko Takahashi, in particular Takahashi's series Urusei Yatsura. To relax, she enjoys playing with her miniature schnauzers, Milky and Kentarō.   Although \"Miku\" is a traditional Japanese given name, \"Mick\" Takeuchi is actually named after Mick Jagger.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mick_lily/)",
