At the time he was very unexperienced with anime production and has [said](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he likely would have been fired for his lack of knowledge and poor quality work, if not for the in-between animation checker teaching him everything from scratch.\n\nLater down the line after establishing himself more in the anime industry, he would go on to work on \"[Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/Tengen-Toppa-Gurren-Lagann/)\" as a challenge to himself, where he would put forth mecha and effects animation he had no idea how to prior.\n\nKojima [states](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he feels a lot of inspiration from manga artists who are able to think about a story, break it up into panels, and express it in pictures. He has thought about drawing a manga himself, even if it's something simple.\n\nSome of his favorite anime are \"[Inital D](https://anilist.co/anime/185/Initial-D/),\" \"[Natsume's Book of Friends](https://anilist.co/anime/4081/Natsume-Yuujinchou/),\" \"[Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-](https://anilist.co/anime/21355/ReZero-kara-Hajimeru-Isekai-Seikatsu/),\" \"[Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Shin-Seiki-Evangelion/),\" \"[A KITE](https://anilist.co/anime/320/A-KITE/),\" \"[JIN-ROH](https://anilist.co/anime/570/JINROH/),\" \"[FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/)\" and \"[Doukyuusei -Classmates-](https://anilist.co/anime/21096/Doukyuusei/).\"\n\nSome of his favorite manga are \"[HI Score Girl](https://anilist.co/manga/74501/Hi-Score-Girl/)\" and \"[A White Rose in Bloom](https://anilist.co/manga/108360/Mejirobana-no-Saku/).\"\n",

He has been affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/) since its establishment.\n\nBorn in Tokyo and raised in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, he discovered his passion for anime during middle school, inspired by classics like [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/Galaxy-Express-999/) and [Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/). It was in high school that he met a like-minded friend with a love for drawing, sparking his aspiration to become an animator. During those formative years, he actively participated in the art club, where he honed his skills and embarked on creating independent anime projects.\n\nAfter graduating from the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he joined Studio Wombat as an in-between animator. During his time at the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he shared the same class with notable contemporaries such as [Mitsuru Obunai](https://anilist.co/staff/103077/Mitsuru-Obunai), [Yutaka Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/101801/Yutaka-Nakamura), and [Junichi Fujisaku](https://anilist.co/staff/100423/Junichi-Fujisaku).
