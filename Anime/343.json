  "description": "Morioka Kouhei wants to become a photographer. Unfortunately, he has the tendency to unintentionally capture the images of ghosts on film.<br><br>\nOne day, he visits an old castle in Germany where he meets a vampire girl, Hazuki. It turns out that Hazuki is confined in the castle against her will. She tries to turn Kouhei into her slave by sucking his blood, with the intent to have him break the device sealing her in the castle. Although Kouhei proves to be immune to the vampire's curse, he is eventually forced to help her. Hazuki successfully escapes from the castle and leaves for Japan to look for her mother.<br><br>\nWhen she arrives in Japan, she goes to Kohei's house where he lives with his grandfather, who agrees to take in the girl. Due to his own childhood experiences, the sympathetic Kouhei agrees to aid Hazuki in her quest.<br><br>\nHowever, other vampires, including Elfried and Count Kinkell, manage to track Hazuki to Japan. They will stop at nothing to retrieve her.<br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

He joined Studio One Pattern in 1981. He made his directorial debut with [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/) in 1994. He joined Shaft in 2004. He has received the 11th Tokyo Anime Award and the 2011 Newtype Anime Award for Best director for his work on the acclaimed anime series [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/).\n\nShinbou was born in Fukushima Prefecture. After high school, he attended Tokyo Designer Institute before entering the anime industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo Design Institute, Shinbou worked as an animator for the 1981 anime series [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/). Shinbou participated with Studio Pierrot in 1990 as an episode director in [Musashi](https://anilist.co/anime/8065/). His first full directorial debut was however the previously mentioned, with Metal Fighter Miku. He continued his early directional career with several OVA series in the late 90's. Shinbou participated with Seven Arcs starting with [Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever](https://anilist.co/anime/176/) in 2003 and then became director for 2004's spin-off [Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha](https://anilist.co/anime/76/).\n\nHis style in particular became noticed during his episode direction work on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/)'s Dark Tournament arc. After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies.
