  "description": "Takakage is troubled by a strange dream, seemingly of a former life as a soldier in the Sengoku Era of Japan. In that life, he loved the miko Ayame, though their love was doomed by war. Now, in this life, he is given a prophecy that he will meet the woman of his dreams.<br><br>\nTakakage, a college student, has been having strange dreams lately. In them, a young shrine priestess named Ayame promises to marry a young, look-alike soldier named Genshiro the night before he is sent to battle. Takakage finds a maiden who looks like the woman from his dreams. With the help of her, his sister, and his fortune-telling friend, he seeks to find the answers of what their, and his, true origins lay.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

He is also praised for his shot composition skills and copies of his layouts are widely distributed in the industry as drawing reference. Nowadays he is mostly only credited for character design in the shows he participates in, but in reality he works as an animation director uncredited quite often. He rarely heavily corrects the key animator's cuts, strongly believing that the animators' distinctiveness should be noticeable.\n\nNoted for his designs on shows like [Haikyuu](https://anilist.co/anime/20464/), [Serial Experiments Lain](https://anilist.co/anime/339/), [Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/), [Baccano](https://anilist.co/anime/2251/) and more.",
