          "description": "An animator turned mangaka, Yasuhiko was born in Hokkaido in December 1947, he dropped out of Hirosaki University in 1970 to work for MushiPro as an animator. In the 70s he became a freelancer and worked on TV anime. Some of his most famous work as a character designer or director are \"Space Battleship Yamato\", \"Brave Raideen\", \"Combattler V\" and \"Mobile Suit Gundam\".\n\nIn 1979, he made his debut as a mangaka with \"Arion\" serialized in the newly founded magazine \"Ryu\". Following this, Yasuhiko alternated between the Anime and Manga worlds with works like \"Kiba - The Legend of White Fang\", \"Crusher Joe\", and \"Giant Gorg\", and \"Star of the Kurds\", \"C-Court\", and \"Venus Wars\".\n\nThese worlds would overlap, when his manga \"Arion\" would get adapted into an anime film in 1986 with the title \"Neo Heroic Fantasia: Arion\". Following this, he would adapt his SF Military Chronicle \"Venus Wars\" into an anime film in 1989. The anime film adaptation for \"Venus Wars\" came at an unfortunate point for Yasuhiko, and the film was sealed, preventing it from being made readily available on home video formats in Japan (though still made accessible overseas). He turned to manga completely and had gained a respectable reputation as a history mangaka with works focusing on both Japanese history with \"Jinmu\", \"Namuji\", \"Yamato Takeru\" and European history with \"Alexandros\", \"Joan\", and Theology with \"Jesus\".\n\nIn 2001 he adapted the First Gundam anime into a manga with \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\" and was colossally popular, being serialized for 24 Tankoban volumes.\n\nWith over 50 years worth of experience across multiple mediums of entertainment and showing no signs of stopping, Yasuhiko's terrific worldview continues to touch the hearts of many around the world.\n\nIn 1981, he won the Seiun Award in the Art category. In 1992, he received the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for his work \"Namuji\". From 1979 to 1982, he ranked first in the Anime Grand Prix for Character Design. In 2000, he won the Japan Media Arts Festival Excellence Prize in the Manga category for \"Ōdō no Inu\". In 2012, he won the Seiun Award in the Best Comic category for \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\". In 2015, he received the Animation Kobe Special Award.",

Also a current advisor for [Satelight](https://anilist.co/studio/41/).\n\nFamous for his work in the [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) and Transformers franchises. He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",
