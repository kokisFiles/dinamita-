  "description": "Misaki, a twenty-nine year old woman, is planning to get married soon. <br>\nOne day, she finds an old pocket watch which belonged to her late father. Unfortunately, it was broken and did not move. <br>\nMisaki finds out that this watch originally belonged to her grandfather. It was her grandfather who gave it to her father. They both worked at the Tokyo Station.<br>\nMisaki's father was always strict and severe, especially to her. That was the only memory she would remember about him. She regrets how they could not connect with each other because she could not communicate with him very well when she was in her teens. <br>\nMisaki visits the Tokyo station, hoping to repair this memorable watch. However, the repair shop was already gone. <br>\nShe drops her shoulders and walks on the platform of the station. Suddenly, she finds a station employee who looks just like her father. <br>\nShe runs and follows this person without even thinking...<br>\n<br>\n(Source: YouTube)",
