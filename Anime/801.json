          "description": "Kanno's earliest experiences with music came from attending church with her parents. She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, Black Magic, which was published in the manga dōjinshi Atlas. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.\n\nThe result was best-selling manga Appleseed, a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of Black Magic and a second volume of Appleseed, he released Dominion in 1986. Two more volumes of Appleseed followed before he began work on Ghost in the Shell.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated again with Production I.G to co-create the original concept for the anime television series Shinreigari/Ghost Hound, Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with Production I.G began airing in April 2008, titled Real Drive.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Upon graduating from university, Okamura joined the animation production studio Madhouse as an animator through the recommendation of a friend. Lensman was the first series he worked on as an animator. The first anime movies that he worked on were Kamui no Ken and Bobby ni Kubittake. \n\nIn 1989, he made his debut as an episode director with Yawara! and soon made his full directorial debut in 1995 with Memories. He later left Madhouse and went freelance, working on several projects along the way.\n\nIn 1991, he changed his first name from Yutaka to Tensai.",

He is also the lead singer of Crown Jewels, and is the current lead guitarist of the New York Dolls. In his youth, Steve was the lead guitarist and backing singer in the band Waddi And The Waddettes. Conte first became known to the music industry through his band Company of Wolves (Mercury Records) in the early 1990s. Steve has done studio and/or live work with artists like Peter Wolf, Willy DeVille, Maceo Parker, Billy Squier, Suzi Quatro, Jill Jones, Paul Simon, Simon & Garfunkel, Phoebe Snow, David Johansen & The Harry Smiths, Chuck Berry, Willie Nile and many others. Conte occasionally plays guitar with Eric Burdon & The Animals.    He has also worked with composer Yoko Kanno and lyricist Tim Jensen in music for several anime series. Steve Conte sang the opening theme, Stray, to the Studio BONES' anime series Wolf's Rain as well as the tracks Heaven's Not Enough and Could You Bite the Hand? on both of the anime's soundtracks. Conte can also be heard in some episodes of Cowboy Bebop, most notably for the song Call Me Call Me, as well as Words That We Couldn't Say, No Reply, and the CD version of Rain, sung by Mai Yamane in the series. More recently, he sang the ending theme to Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG; Living Inside the Shell alongside with Shanti Snyder. He also performed on the duet \"The Garden of Everything\" with Japanese singer Maaya Sakamoto on her RahXephon-related single \"Tune the Rainbow\".    He most recently provided the vocals for the video game Sonic and the Secret Rings closing credits song titled Worth a Chance, and the game's main theme Seven Rings In Hand. Songs which did not make the final soundtrack of the game include Midget In A Rocket and Lute To A Cow.    Currently, Conte is planning another tour, during 2009, as evidenced by a poster he left on the MySpace website for Deborah Harry (lead singer of the band Blondie).    ",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/885163337809395712)\n\nAn irreplaceable member of the Japanese animation industry.\n\nInoue is an animator of the realist school whose skills are among the best in the world. He is known to often handle immense amounts of work in the titles he partakes in. Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",
