  "description": "It is 199X A.D. In Kushiro, Hokkaido, three bodies of Dragonite appear. Possessing overwhelming destructive force, they attack the city. They also awaken the evil Jashin Drago from the holy seal he was trapped in. 200 years ago, Drago was trapped in the seal by a holy warrior with the tattooed mark of the Liger. Assuming that the warrior is dead, Drago and Empress Zara are free to conquer the Earth using their army of biomechanical beasts. Even the Japan Self-Defense Forces are no match for the Dragonites' awesome power. One of the people fleeing is the protagonist, a milquetoast 16 year old boy named Ken Taiga. Unbeknownst to the Dragonites, Ken realizes that he is the descendant of the Liger warrior! In a burst of anger, Ken's Liger birthmark appears, and he rises his palm into the air, shouting the henshin command, \"LIGER!!!\", which then covers him in demonic long-haired biomechanical armor. Ken transforms into Jushin Liger to fight the evil forces of the Dragonite! (Wikipedia)",

Soon after, at the age of 19, he got his first major break when he landed the role of mecha designer on [Dancouga: Super Beast Machine God](https://anilist.co/anime/2255/). Not too long after, at the young age of 21, he was given his first directorial role by directing episodes 5 and 6 of the [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/) OVA series. \n\nOobari mainly likes to work within the sci-fi mecha and fighting genres. His designs are easily recognizable from the voluptuous female forms and well-toned pretty boys he tends to create to appeal to wide audiences. For references, he likes to use images of professional wrestlers and models. He is friends with fellow former animator and current freelance illustrator [Tsukasa Kotoboki](https://anilist.co/staff/97965/).\n\nHe wasn't originally interested in animation but was inspired by [Satoshi Urushihara](https://anilist.co/staff/98177/).",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/若林厚史)\n\nVeteran Japanese animator, storyboard artist, and director. After joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/) and then [Tatsunoko Production](https://anilist.co/studio/103/), Wakabayashi finally landed at [Studio Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/), where he was considered the backbone of the studio's animation in the 90s. \n\nHe is known for his bombastic animation style, which makes the designs he draws look malleable and often exaggerated. He was influenced by animators such as [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Kouji Morimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100066/), and he is also a friend of [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/). His direction is inspired by Japanese live-action cinema as well as French directors such as Luc Besson.\n\nWakabayashi gained considerable notoriety on the NARUTO series, which he was invited to work on by [Hayato Date](https://anilist.co/staff/100843/) after a chance meeting at Pierrot. He is best known for storyboarding and directing episode 167 of [NARUTO: Shippuuden](https://anilist.co/anime/1735/): Naruto vs. Pain.\n\nHis main focus in anime these days is more on storyboarding, as he feels that the changes in the anime industry do not allow him to animate as freely as he used to.",
