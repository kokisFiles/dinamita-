  "description": "Everyone knows about the story of Shahrazad and her wonderful tales of the Arabian nights. For one thousand and one nights, she entertained the mad Sultan with the adventures of Aladdin, Ali Baba, Sinbad, genies, and many other mystical creatures. But what if Shahrazad was actually a boy desperate to save his sister's life? What kind of strange things would he do to make sure that he survives to tell the tale? This new twist on one of the greatest classical folk tales just might keep you awake for another One Thousand and One Nights.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

While in Jeju, she was active in an amateur manhwa club called Odin (오딘), and later graduated from the Manga Department of Gongju Junior College. She then moved to Seoul to work at an illustration company. \n\nShe debuted in 1995 with \"Kiki and Funny Joe\" as part of the Daenggi's New Artist Contest (댕기의 신인작가공모전), while also active in another amateur manhwa club called ch4. After several one shots, she progressed onto longer series, but there were always reviews saying the stories were disappointing compared to the beautiful art. Eventually she overcame this by collaborating with writers, her first collaboration being [One Thousand and One Nights](https://anilist.co/manga/35310/One-Thousand-and-One-Nights/), and later [Scholar who Walks the Night](https://anilist.co/manga/93065/Bameur-Geonneun-Seonbi/), which was adapted into a popular K-drama.\n\nTo satisfy her desire to create stories, she has written several romance novels.",

He is currently an adjunct professor in the Department of Manhwa Creation at Chungkang University of Culture and Industry, and a game scenario instructor at the Yonsei Digital Game Education Center.\n\nHe launched his career in 1998 with \"The Last Fantasy,\" a shounen manhwa sci-fi series. Jeon has also recently acquired a solid reputation for his skill as a meticulously subtle shojo writer. \n\nHe met his wife-to-be in the summer of 2003 when he was very depressed after the cancellation of a magazine that published his work. It was the lowest point of his manhwa career, and he was even considering quitting comics altogether, but she was always by his side and helped him return to comics with \"One Thousand and One Nights.\" They were married on November 25th, 2006. \n\nMajor works: Gun Beat, Last Fantasy, Combat Bible, Merlin's Magic School, One Thousand and One Nights",
