  "description": "In the near-future Japan, global warming has brought the large city Yokohama underwater, and only the hills remain above the ocean surface. What used to be one of the largest cities in Japan now feels like a small town. Basically, the existence of the island country itself has been threatened. However, there is no feeling of desperation, devastation, nor hopelessness. People are enjoying laid-back lives, and they seem to appreciate each other's company, enjoying the quiet and peaceful time together.<br><br>\nThis is especially so with Alpha, a carefree young woman who runs a cafe, named Cafe Alpha. She enjoys her life immersing herself in the beautiful nature all around her. There is nothing more precious to her than spending quality time with her kind friends. Oh, the fulfillment and the joy she finds in life... it all indicates her to be a compassionate human being, but she is not quite a human. She is actually a type A7M2 robot.<br><br>\nOne day, upon hearing a radio forecast warning an approaching typhoon, her old friend who lives close by invites her to the gas station he runs, worried that her old cafe may not withstand the typhoon. Indeed, the passing of typhoon leaves Alpha with her cafe severely damaged. That's when she decides to go on a journey to raise money to rebuild her cafe, and also to see the outside world away from her friends and the comfort of a peaceful life.<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

Another notable work is Position. He has also been known to create doujinshi under the name \"suke\". Prior to his debut, Ashinano worked as an assistant to manga artist [Kosuke Fujishima](https://anilist.co/staff/97467). His work also usually has a rather laid-back, nostalgic feel with undertones of mystery; there are frequent stretches with little or no dialogue.",

          "description": "Members: \n• Shigeharu Sasago\n• Oh Akioka\n• Jyoji Sawada.    \n\nThe bandolim performer Oh Akioka has his roots in Brazilian music, although he is active in a wide variety of genres and is not bound by any one specific style. Shigeharu Sasago is a unique guitarist who has created his own highly distinctive style through the absorption of Brazilian groove. The double bassist Jyoji Sawada is also a well-known composer of contemporary music. He sensitively supports the sound of Choro Club from below.    The acoustic string trio Choro Club was formed in 1989 by three musicians, each with his own distinctive character and musical aspirations. They recorded their first album in 1990. The group’s name is taken from the choro, a style of instrumental music with its origins in Rio de Janeiro. While generating the mood of the choro, they create a musical world sometimes intense and sometimes sentimental, through the exercise of their highly original collective sensibility. Almost all the numbers on their previous 18 albums were composed by the members of the trio themselves. It isn’t possible to assign the music of Choro Club to any standard category. That’s because the sound created by these three musicians is truly unique. \n\nOver the past decade Choro Club have performed not only in standard concert halls and clubs but also in a wide variety of venues including classical concert halls, art museums, galleries, aquariums, botanical gardens, Shinto shrines, beer breweries and various other open-air locations, and at jazz festivals. The music of Choro Club has been highly praised for its creativity even in Brazil, the country of origin of the choro. They recorded their third album in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, and a solo open-air concert they gave on that occasion, organized by the Department of Tourism of the City of Rio de Janeiro, was attended by as many as 3,000 people and was given prominent coverage, along with the scene of recording, by local newspapers and TV and radio broadcasts. In 1995, Choro Club was sponsored by the Japan Foundation on a concert tour of six Latin American countries including Brazil. Subsequently, in 2003, they collaborated with Tomi Taira, a well-known actress from Okinawa, on an original musical play \"NIRAIKANAI\", at Sao Paulo, Brazil. Choro Club has released 3 albums in 2005 - \"PREVENDO\" from King records, then the soundtrack for \"ARIA\", the popular Japanese TV animation, released by Victor Entertainment, and their greatest hits album \"REVENDO\" from BMG, which includes a selection of their works from 1990 to 1994. And in 2006 and 2008, released 2 more soundtracks for \"ARIA\"series. In 2009, just released their latest album \" Trilogia\" from VideoArts Music Inc. Choro Club have established their own unprecedented and unique sound for 20 years they have been working together. The members of Choro Club strive to achieve not only a high degree of musical sophistication but also a truly adult sense of relaxation and pleasure. Their music continues to offer universal potential.    \n\nSource:  http://www.players.ne.jp/~choro/prof-e.html",

It was only later that he joined the animation industry in 1964. He started quickly making a name for himself as a background artist and consequently established his own background art studio Kobayashi Production, in 1968. During this time thick poster paint was dominating the backgrounds in anime, but Kobayashi started a new style with much thinner painting and colored pencil strokes.\n\nHe has worked as an art director on over 100 titles and is one of the most distinguished art directors in the medium. Notable works include [Gamba no Bouken](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/), [Ie Naki Ko](https://anilist.co/anime/2828/), [Takarajima](https://anilist.co/anime/2618/), [Tenshi no Tamago](https://anilist.co/anime/885/), [Utena](https://anilist.co/anime/440/), [Berserk](https://anilist.co/anime/33/) and [Nodame Cantabile](https://anilist.co/anime/1698/).\n\nKobayashi retired from the industry in 2010, which was followed by his studio's closedown a year later.\n\nIn a 2015 [interview](https://youtu.be/V1tiKOsCz2M), Kobayashi talked about his life and passion in painting touring his atelier and showcasing his work.",
