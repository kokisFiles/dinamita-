  "description": "1-3) <b>Your Story I Have Known</b><br>\nHigh-school student Matsumoto Haato has fallen in love with his abusive mother's ex-boyfriend, yakuza Shibusawa, who was nice to him in the past. When he has nowhere left to go he turns to the gruff but kind older man. A three chapter love story that details the changing relationship between the two men over the years.\n<br><br>\n4) <b>Sauté d'oignon</b><br>\nWhen two people are together, the sweetness and the spiciness of love are the greatest flavors. High school student Negi and Tama have been together since elementary school, and now Negi is ready to move their relationship to a new level, but Tama's still unsure...\n<br><br>\n5) <b>Koe ga Todoku no Nara</b> (If the Voice Reaches)<br>\nShouta is constantly getting in fights, but despite that, he's a nice guy. One day, while saving someone from some bullies, a weirdo samurai guy shows up and tells him he's haunting him. Now Shouta must deal with this constant spiritual companion... and all the emotions that come with him!\n<br><br>\n6) <b>Kami-sama no Me wo Nusunde</b><br>\nNarasaki still vividly remembers the day in high school when his friend confessed to him, and his heartless response. Years later when he is confessed to by another guy, he's determined to give Wakatsuki the chance he didn't give his friend. But is he seeing the man in front of him, or just reliving the past?\n",
