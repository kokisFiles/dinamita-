          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/奥山玲子)\n\nReiko Okuyama was notable for being one of the first female animators in the anime industry.\n\nShe spent much of her early life confined to bed due to a series of illnesses, and developed her interest in drawing during this time. After the end of World War II, she entered mission school. After graduation, she entered Tohoku University as per her father's wishes, but she eventually dropped out and left her home town to work in Tokyo.\n\nIn 1957, Okuyama applied for a position at Toei Animation, mistakenly believing that they were publishers of children's books. Her drawing skills were enough for her to be hired as an in-betweener. Her first work was on the landmark feature film, [Panda and the Magic Serpent](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) in 1958. She was later promoted to 2nd key animator on [Magic Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/4948/), in spite of some sexual discrimination on the part of the studio heads. She was later promoted to key animator, and eventually to animation director.\n\nShe went freelance after briefly joining her husband [Youichi Kotabe](https://anilist.co/staff/115532/) at Nippon Animation. As a freelancer she worked as a printmaker, went on to illustrate several children's books and continued to teach animation at the Tokyo Designer Academy, which she had been doing since 1985.\n\nOkuyama passed away from pneumonia on May 6, 2007.",

After passing the test Ootsuka worked with [Yasuji Mori](https://anilist.co/staff/103602/) and [Akira Daikubara](https://anilist.co/staff/131868/) on the [Tale of the White Serpent](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and learnt their approaches. Wanting to learn more animation theory, he began to seek out textbooks and was shown a textbook on US animation written by Preston Blair. After working on [Magic Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/4948/) in 1959 his animation of a skeleton was unintentionally considered comical due to its realism. This led to comical bad guy characters becoming Ootsuka's speciality.\n\nOotsuka believed that genuine realism doesn't suit animation and \"constructed realism\" is more suitable. [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) compared Ootsuka to Kenichi Enomoto, a Japanese comedian, in the use of this approach. After completion of his next film [The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots](https://anilist.co/anime/2279/) Ootsuka left Toei to join [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/), then A Production.\n\nOotsuka wrote several books about the anime industry. His Sakuga Asemamire is considered \"a prime resource for the history of '60s and '70s anime.\"\n\nIn July 2002 an exhibition of his work and personal pieces was held in Ginza.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
