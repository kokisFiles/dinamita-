          "description": "Zodiac: Virgo\nBirth Place: Kanagawa-prefecture, Japan\n\nKoide Mieko has a somewhat bipolar approach to storytelling. Her works cover the range from a sweet love story involving a haunted apartment to darker stories of love within obsession. From the beginning of one of her manga, it is often difficult to discern what type of series it will be, as she keeps many secrets as her tale unfolds. Her stories are generally set in everyday life with ordinary people, although occasionally she throws in a bit of the supernatural to keep you off balance. Her works involve exclusively homosexual male pairings, handled with a realism that the genre rarely sees.\n\n(Source: Senshi Gakuen) ",
