Mashimo studied jurisprudence at Sophia University and during his fourth university year, he participated in the making of several television commercials. However, this was a rather disappointing experience, and on November 6, 1975, he applied for a position of Hiroshi Sasagawa's assistant director in Tatsunoko Production. The first anime series he worked on was Time Bokan (1975–76).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, while still working for Tatsunoko, Mashimo survived a severe alpine skiing accident. During his stay in an intensive care unit, he came up with an idea of a \"hospital for animators\", an animation studio whose primary goal would be fostering and self-actualization of talented artists rather than commercial success and money. Some time after that, he founded a small freelance studio called Mashimo Jimusho that was mainly producing in-between animation for larger companies. In 1997, Mashimo presented his studio-as-hospital concept to Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, the president of Production I.G, who was so impressed with it that he immediately agreed to sponsor Mashimo. The new subsidiary has become known as Bee Train and in February 2006, it ended its relationship with I.G and became independent.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

After joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/) and then [Tatsunoko Production](https://anilist.co/studio/103/), Wakabayashi finally landed at [Studio Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/), where he was considered the backbone of the studio's animation in the 90s. \n\nHe is known for his bombastic animation style, which makes the designs he draws look malleable and often exaggerated. He was influenced by animators such as [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Kouji Morimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100066/), and he is also a friend of [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/). His direction is inspired by Japanese live-action cinema as well as French directors such as Luc Besson.\n\nWakabayashi gained considerable notoriety on the NARUTO series, which he was invited to work on by [Hayato Date](https://anilist.co/staff/100843/) after a chance meeting at Pierrot. He is best known for storyboarding and directing episode 167 of [NARUTO: Shippuuden](https://anilist.co/anime/1735/): Naruto vs. Pain.\n\nHis main focus in anime these days is more on storyboarding, as he feels that the changes in the anime industry do not allow him to animate as freely as he used to.",
