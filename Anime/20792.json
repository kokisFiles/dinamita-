  "description": "The Holy Grail War continues, with each Master and Servant duo making their move for the omnipotent wish granter. Caster’s plans have been set in motion, beginning with taking Saber captive while Rin and Archer go their separate ways to continue their fights on their own. Without Saber’s aid, Shirou’s principles are put to the ultimate test. With many battles to come with expected and unexpected enemies, Shirou’s resolve begins to take form. Is his desire to protect people and become a hero, genuine? Or are they simply borrowed feelings? And will it be enough to carry him to the end?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Aniplex of America)",

Her name comes from the verb \"aimer\" in French which means \"to love.\" She is known for being a faceless voice. She very rarely appears on her music videos and most of her live performances are dimly lit to obscure her face. She finally revealed herself on the August 20, 2016 episode of Music Station.\n\nHer father was the bassist of a band, so Aimer grew up surrounded by music from a very young age. She began studying the piano in elementary school and highly looked up to Ringo Sheena and Utada Hikaru. In junior high school, listening to Avril Lavigne inspired her to take up guitar and began writing English lyrics. At the age of 15, Aimer lost her voice due to over-usage of her vocal cords and was forced to undergo silence therapy for treatment. However, that did not stop her, and after she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky voice.\n\nAimer teamed up with the \"Agehasprings\" group, which has worked with, produced, or provided music for various artists, including Yuki, Mika Nakashima, Flumpool, Superfly, Yuzu, and Genki Rockets. In 2011, her musical career began in earnest. In May 2011, they released the concept album \"Your Favorite Things.\" It covered numerous popular works, including works in various genre such as jazz and country western music.\n\nMarried [Masahiro Tobinai](https://anilist.co/staff/146979/Masahiro-Tobinai) in 2023.",

Married to [Momoko Kamiya](https://anilist.co/staff/250361).\n\nUpon enrolling at Osaka University of Arts, Yuuichi Terao, alongside [Takashi Suhara](https://anilist.co/staff/146678/Takashi-Suhara) and others, embarked on the autonomous creation of animated films, even organizing screenings through university circles in the Kanto region. After joining animation production company ufotable in December 2003, Terao, initially aspiring for the production department as a production manager but he was assigned to the newly formed photography department (now the Digital Imaging Department) due to presenting visual materials during his interview. Despite lacking prior photography expertise, he learned from scratch, commencing his career as a compositor. From 2007 onwards, Terao transitioned to the role of \"Director of Photography\" in notable works such as \"The Garden of Sinners.\" Presently serving as Chief of ufotable's Digital Imaging Department, he oversees photography and CG, contributing significantly to ufotable's works. Beyond photography and CG, Terao actively engages in various roles, including animation, background sections, directing, and storyboarding, even participating in the early stages of background art creation. Noteworthy for his involvement in promotional videos and commercials, Terao gained attention for creating faction-specific commercials for the TV anime [Fate/Zero](https://anilist.co/anime/10087/FateZero/) in 2011. \n\nHis directorial contributions extend to ufotable works' opening sequences and game animations, with a notable debut as a storyboard artist and director in the final episode of the 2019 TV anime [Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/). Terao's multifaceted contributions align with his belief in animation as a collective art form, emphasizing teamwork in production. \n\nRecognized for his expertise in integrating 3DCG seamlessly with characters and background art, Terao's artistic approach aims for high-quality animation. His \"photorealistic\" visuals, adopted since 2007, have been praised, contributing to his receipt of the Tokyo Anime Award 2022's \"Individual Award\".",

Her name comes from the verb \"aimer\" in French which means \"to love.\" She is known for being a faceless voice. She very rarely appears on her music videos and most of her live performances are dimly lit to obscure her face. She finally revealed herself on the August 20, 2016 episode of Music Station.\n\nHer father was the bassist of a band, so Aimer grew up surrounded by music from a very young age. She began studying the piano in elementary school and highly looked up to Ringo Sheena and Utada Hikaru. In junior high school, listening to Avril Lavigne inspired her to take up guitar and began writing English lyrics. At the age of 15, Aimer lost her voice due to over-usage of her vocal cords and was forced to undergo silence therapy for treatment. However, that did not stop her, and after she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky voice.\n\nAimer teamed up with the \"Agehasprings\" group, which has worked with, produced, or provided music for various artists, including Yuki, Mika Nakashima, Flumpool, Superfly, Yuzu, and Genki Rockets. In 2011, her musical career began in earnest. In May 2011, they released the concept album \"Your Favorite Things.\" It covered numerous popular works, including works in various genre such as jazz and country western music.\n\nMarried [Masahiro Tobinai](https://anilist.co/staff/146979/Masahiro-Tobinai) in 2023.",
