  "description": "Fujimoto Hiroya is at the top of his class. He's the Student Council Vice-President, spends all his time studying and is the idol of all the \"good girls\".  But the truth is, he'd trade it all just for the chance to be someone else... someone popular, outgoing and carefree... Someone like Masaki.<br><br>\nMasaki's what Fujimoto's friends would call an \"idiot\".  He'd rather play soccer than study, almost never cracks a book, and is popular with all the \"normal\" kids.  He's got flashy clothes, bleached hair and a reputation just a lousy as Fujimoto's is good.<br><br>\nIn the summer of Fujimoto's freshman year of high school, he resolves to change his image and his life... all to make friends with Masaki.  But can dyed hair, new clothes and a piercing really change a person inside? <br><br>\nClassic BL by the \"dream-team\" of novelist Koh Akizuki and mangaka Meiko Koide. <br><br>\nPlease note that this title deals very frankly with some rather \"heavy\" issues including, but not limited to homophobia, gay bashing, coming out, HIV/AIDS, promiscuous sex, rape, and suicide.<br>\n(Source: DokiDoki)",

          "description": "Zodiac: Virgo\nBirth Place: Kanagawa-prefecture, Japan\n\nKoide Mieko has a somewhat bipolar approach to storytelling. Her works cover the range from a sweet love story involving a haunted apartment to darker stories of love within obsession. From the beginning of one of her manga, it is often difficult to discern what type of series it will be, as she keeps many secrets as her tale unfolds. Her stories are generally set in everyday life with ordinary people, although occasionally she throws in a bit of the supernatural to keep you off balance. Her works involve exclusively homosexual male pairings, handled with a realism that the genre rarely sees.\n\n(Source: Senshi Gakuen) ",
