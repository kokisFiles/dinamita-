          "description": "[Official Website](https://tezukaosamu.net)\n\nOsamu Tezuka was a legendary Japanese Mangaka and Doctor of Medicine. Tezuka made his manga debut in 1946 with [The Diary of Ma-chan](https://anilist.co/manga/52202) (マアちゃんの日記帳, Machan no Nikkicho) for the children's newspaper Mainichi Shogakusei Shinbun (Mainichi Elementary Schoolchildren's Newspaper) while he was a student at Osaka University. His breakout work, '[New Treasure Island](https://anilist.co/manga/41273)' (新宝島, Shin Takarajima) was in 1947, followed three years later by '[Jungle Emperor](https://anilist.co/manga/31771)' (ジャングル大帝, Jungle Taitei), which was serialized in Manga-Shonen.\n\nFrom a very young age, Osamu Tezuka had been a great fan of Disney animation. Tezuka was also very successful in the animation field. Not only did he do the first TV anime ([Astroboy](https://anilist.co/anime/2747), 1963), but he also produced the first Japanese color anime series ([Jungle Emperor](https://anilist.co/anime/1572), 1965). Influenced by Disney and old movies, Tezuka has in turn influenced countless numbers of Japanese mangaka. Tezuka's works are being reprinted again and again, earning him the undisputed title of 'God of Manga.' In 1994, the city of Takarazuka, where he grew up, inaugurated The Osamu Tezuka Manga Museum. And in 1997, postage stamps with his artwork were sold in Japan.\n\nIn 1971 the semi-annual Tezuka awards were established by the magazine Weekly Shonen Jump. In 1997 a different award named after Tezuka, namely the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, was brought into life.\n\nThe impact Tezuka has had on Japanese Manga is almost impossible to exaggerate, because he created the present form of the medium. Maybe it stems from his medical education or from the Japanese character, but Tezuka had an enormous respect for life. This respect is a theme that can be traced throughout his work, reflected in his life's work, '[Phoenix](https://anilist.co/manga/31325)'. He has reportedly made about 150,000 pages of manga in his life, and has been awarded many prizes for his efforts. Many of Tezuka's work have been translated into English as well as French, Italian, Korean, and so forth. Other characters Osamu Tezuka created include [Unico](https://anilist.co/manga/47240) and [Black Jack](https://anilist.co/manga/31600).\n\nIn 1989 an asteroid was named after Tezuka and [Toshio Ban](https://anilist.co/staff/127281), one of Tezuka's former assistants serialized a manga biography entitled The Osamu Tezuka Story (手塚治虫物語, Osamu Tezuka Monogatari and it was released in English in 2016.\n\nHe is considered the Japanese equivalent to [Walt Disney](https://anilist.co/staff/139600), who served as a major inspiration during his formative years. His prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as \"the Father of Manga\" and \"the Godfather of Manga\".\n\n(Sources: MangaUpdates, Wikipedia)",

Upon graduating from university, Okamura joined the animation production studio Madhouse as an animator through the recommendation of a friend. Lensman was the first series he worked on as an animator. The first anime movies that he worked on were Kamui no Ken and Bobby ni Kubittake. \n\nIn 1989, he made his debut as an episode director with Yawara! and soon made his full directorial debut in 1995 with Memories. He later left Madhouse and went freelance, working on several projects along the way.\n\nIn 1991, he changed his first name from Yutaka to Tensai.",

He then founded [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/) together with fellow former Mushi Pro employees, [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/). At Madhouse, he debuted as a director on 1984's [Lensman](https://anilist.co/anime/2770/), albeit still jointly with the more experienced [Kazunori Hirokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170070/). Kawajiri made his full-fledged directorial debuts in 1987, with [Wicked City](https://anilist.co/anime/1107/) and Running Man, the latter being a short film a part of an anthology collection, [Neo Tokyo](https://anilist.co/anime/1951/). Wicked City was originally meant to be a short film as well, but the producers were impressed enough in Kawajiri to let him turn it into a feature-length film. After these, Kawajiri directed [the third installment](https://anilist.co/anime/2998/) of Madhouse's adaptations of the highly acclaimed [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/) manga series, [Phoenix](https://anilist.co/manga/31325/).\n\nWicked City received critical and commercial success upon its release, giving Kawajiri more creative freedom. As a result of this he began writing the script for his own original film, [Ninja Scroll](https://anilist.co/anime/617/), a movie set in feudal Japan following a mercenary swordsman battling a team of ninjas with supernatural powers who are intent on overthrowing the Tokugawa shogunate. After the movie's international release, Kawajiri's status as a director received global recognition and he went on to direct multiple other works in the late '90s and early '00s.\n\nIn recent years, Kawajiri has taken a step back from directing, but has been guest appearing as a storyboard artist all over the industry.",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

After having worked as a cel painter in commercial animation, he joined [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/) in 1958 for a brief time working on films such as [Hakujaden](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and [Saiyuuki](https://anilist.co/anime/4481/). After having been told that he couldn't work as a director due to not being a college graduate, he moved to [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) - making his directorial debut as one of the regular episode directors on [Tetsuwan Atom](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/).\n\nIn 1972, Rintarou left Mushi Pro to go freelance and to co-found [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11) together with [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/). A few years later, Rintarou got invited to direct [Jetter Mars](https://anilist.co/anime/6087/) at his previously disinterested workplace, Toei Animation. He accepted the offer but didn't join the studio as an employee, making him one of the few people who've directed for the studio while not being an inhouse employee. He continued to direct multiple entries for Toei, including [Arrow Emblem](https://anilist.co/anime/3800/), [Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/), as well as the 1979 film [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1301/), which is still considered by many as his best work.\n\n[Haruki Kadokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170354/), the president of [Kadokawa Shoten](https://anilist.co/studio/113/), took notice of the commercial success of Rintarou's works and hired him to direct [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/), which was the very first film produced by Kadokawa. The animation production was handled by Madhouse, where Rintarou changed his post at this time. There he continued his directorial efforts with numerous films and OVA series.\n\nThe older brother of [Masayuki Hayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/161046/).",

          "description": "Affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/), where he currently serves as the chief of the ufotable Art Department.\n\nWith a career spanning over 50 years in the anime industry, Ebisawa is recognized as one of the longest-serving background artists. He made his debut in 1969, contributing to the art staff of [Himitsu no Akko-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/3285/Himitsu-no-Akkochan/). Over the years, Ebisawa freelanced for various studios, leaving his artistic mark on iconic scenes in productions like [Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone](https://anilist.co/anime/1435/Lupin-III-The-Secret-of-Mamo/), [Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/Macross-Do-You-Remember-Love/), and others.\n\nIn 1980, he took on the role of art director for [Cyborg 009: Legend of the Super Galaxy](https://anilist.co/anime/7336/Cyborg-009-Legend-of-the-Super-Galaxy/), initiating a career in art direction for theatrical and OVA productions. Despite his reluctance for the position, he continued to contribute to notable works. After a hiatus from the role, he returned as art director for [The Garden of Sinners: Chapter 4 – The Hollow Shrine](https://anilist.co/anime/4280/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-4-garannodou-The-Hollow-Shrine/) in 2008.\n\nEbisawa's unique approach includes hand-drawing backgrounds using traditional methods like paper, brushes, and poster colors, a style that distinguishes him in an era dominated by digital techniques. Notably, he personally handled the majority of cuts in The Garden of Sinners: Chapter 4 – The Hollow Shrine.\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 65, Ebisawa expanded his role by taking on the position of art director for the anime series [Today's Menu for the Emiya Family](https://anilist.co/anime/100855/Todays-Menu-for-the-Emiya-Family/). His contributions extend beyond individual projects, as he plays a crucial role in training new talents at ufotable, As part of the training program for new staff, they are obliged to work exclusively on hand-drawn background art using poster colors, similar to Ebisawa's style, for a certain period after joining the company. This practice aims to improve the drawing skills of the art staff, resulting in the inclusion of hand-drawn backgrounds in many ufotable works. Throughout his career, Ebisawa's dedication to the artistry of animation has left an indelible mark on the industry.",
