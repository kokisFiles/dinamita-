In July 2020, she married fellow voice actor [Kensho Ono](https://anilist.co/staff/95819), whom she had been dating since 2017. \n\n__Early Career__\nHanazawa originally became a child actress at the age of 8. Amongst other roles, she starred in the well-known TV school show _Appare Sanma Daisensei_ and the TV series _Gakkou no Sensei_. At that time she was contracted to Big Apple, and later to Five Eight and Smile Monkey.\n\n__Voice Acting Career__\nAt the age of 14, she made her voice acting debut in 2003 as Holly in _[Last Exile](https://anilist.co/anime/97/)_. Three years later in 2006, she was selected for a major role in TV Tokyo's anime mecha series _[Zegapain](https://anilist.co/anime/878/)_. She was playing the main character's childhood friend, [Kaminagi Ryouko](https://anilist.co/character/2578/), and her performance was one of the main reasons for the character's popularity amongst fans. It was afterwards that she came under contract at prestigious voice acting talent agency Office Osawa in 2007.\n\nHanazawa went to university in 2007, while at the same time, she began to make her mark as a voice actress. She was voted in 2010 as \"Best Female Voice Actress\" by listeners of the radio program Nonko and Nobita's Anime Scramble. She graduated from university in 2011, and in the same year became a full-time voice actress.\n\nHanazawa won Best Supporting Actress at the 9th Seiyuu Awards for her role as [Kosaki Onodera](https://anilist.co/character/52723/) in _[Nisekoi](https://anilist.co/anime/18897/)_. She also won Newtype's Best Voice Actress award in 2015 and later in 2018.\n\n__Music Career__\nOn February 23, 2012, it was announced that Hanazawa would launch her official website. A few days later, during the Kana Hanazawa Solo Debut Presentation Party event, it was announced that she would release four singles within a year: \"Hoshizora Destination\" on April 25, \"Hatsukoi no Oto\" released on July 18, \"Happy Endings\" on October 24 (an ending theme for _[Zetsuen no Tempest](https://anilist.co/anime/14075/)_), and \"Silent Snow\" on January 16, 2013. Her first album Claire was released on February 20, 2013, and her second album 25 was released on February 26, 2014. She released an album title Blue Avenue in April 2015 and went on a concert tour starting at the Nippon Budokan on May 3. The Blu-ray release of the show, Live Avenue Kana Hanazawa in Budokan, ranked number six in sales.\n\n__Trivia__\n- She was invited to Anime Festival Asia 2010 on stage.\n- She used to be a junior idol in Akihabara where hundreds of people came to watch her, which is how she got her breakthrough for her acting career in commercials before becoming a voice actress.\n\n**Non-anime roles:**\n- [Marie](https://anilist.co/character/89069/Marie) - Persona 4 Golden (VG)\n- Hakari Atsuko - Blue Archive (VG)\n- Illya - Memento Mori (VG)\n- Marian - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Modernia - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Alice Kuonji (Caster) - Fate/Grand Order (VG)",

Her father had spent 9 years abroad and was fluent in English, which allowed her to develop fluency in the language. From an early age she had an interest in anime, in particular the series _Ojamajo Doremi_ and _Sailor Moon_. However, it was the anime series _Fullmetal Alchemist_ that was the first to inspire her to become a voice actress. At the time, she was impressed that the series' protagonist Edward Elric was voiced by a female actress, [Romi Park](https://anilist.co/staff/95082/Romi-Park).\n\nIn junior high school and high school, she became part of a chorus club to help her overcome her tone deafness. It was also during this time she decided to pursue a voice acting career as she had interacted with schoolmates who had similar interests. Her parents approved of her decision, provided that she pass her university entrance exams. \n\n__Voice Acting Career__\nWhile in high school, she began attending the Japan Narration Acting Institute. After 3 years of training, she passed her audition and joined the agency Arts Vision. At the same time, she also passed her entrance exam and began studying at Waseda University. She debuted as a voice actress in 2010 and later that year she played her first main role in the anime series _The World God Only Knows_. Throughout her 4 years in University, she continued to work as a voice actress, successfully managing both her work and school responsibilities. She graduated in March 2014 and left Art Vision shortly after on April 1. On May 1, 2014, she transferred to the agency Intention and is currently affiliated with them today.\n\n__Music Career__\nHer music career began when she released songs for _The World God Only Knows_ under her character name Kanon Nakagawa. In 2013, she became part of the music group Rhodanthe*, which performed theme songs for the _Kiniro Mosaic_ series. After having been cast in 2015, she has also released singles as her Idolmaster character Mizuki Kawashima. In 2016, she voiced a member of the in-universe music group Walküre, which performed songs for the anime series _Macross Δ_.\n\nIn 2017, she made her solo debut as a singer on February 1 with the release of her single \"True Destiny\" / \"Chain the World\" under the Flying Dog label. Later that year, her second single \"Ima Koko\" / \"Tsuki ga Kirei\" was released on May 24 as well as her first album _Rainbow_ on October 25. In 2018, she held her first solo live event at the Nippon Budokan on February 3 and released her third single \"Tomoshibi no Manima ni\" on May 30. In 2019, she released her second album _Gunjou Infinity_ on April 3. During the months of August and September, she held her first tour live event performing in the cities of Osaka, Nagoya, and Yokohama as well as cities outside of Japan like Taipei and Shanghai. In 2020, her fourth single \"Aruite Ikou!\" is set to release on February 5.\n\n__Non-Anime Roles:__\n- Misono Mika in \"Blue Archive\" (VG)\n- Mualani in \"Genshin Impact\" (VG)\n- Juna Crawford - The Legend of Heroes Series (VG)",
