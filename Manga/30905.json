  "description": "Watch as the worlds of anime voice acting and high school hockey collide! The boyishly handsome Shino is greeted at his front door one morning by the seventeen-year old son he didn’t know he had. Suddenly pushed into the position of being a father and a provider, Shino starts taking on new acting jobs, including boys’ love drama CDs, and the separation between art and life narrows significantly when his new coworkers start taking quite a bit of interest in him! As if that weren’t enough, his son Nakaya is a handful in and of himself. An aspiring hockey player with a bit of an attitude problem, Nakaya has a lot of growing up to do, and Shino is in for the long haul.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Blu)",
