  "description": "Olympic track star. MIT whiz-kid. Adored by the beautiful co-ed's. Revered by classmates and teammates alike. Yu was sitting on top of the world.\n<br><br>\nThat is, until the evil seductress Payetta, leader of an outlaw gang of boozers and brawlers, kidnaps Yu at knifepoint and steals him away to her hideout. He learns he's actually the son of Gilgamesh, the legendary founder and ruler of the ancient yet highly advanced civilization of Agartha. The history lesson doesn't stop there, though. Payetta claims to be the granddaughter of Adolf Hitler and wants to share her maniacal dreams with Yu and the new dystopia she plans to create.\n",

Despite his age, his first two collaborative efforts (1973's <i>AIUEO Boy</i> with Kazuo Koike and 1974's <i>Otoko Gumi</i> with Tetsu Kariya) proved so popular they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators.\n",

          "description": "__Height__: 183 cm\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kazuo_Koike/)\n\nKoike was a prolific Japanese manga writer, novelist and entrepreneur. \n\nEarly in Koike's career, he studied under *Golgo 13* creator [Takao Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/97907/Takao-Saitou) and served as a writer on the series. \n\nKoike, along with artist Goseki Kojima, made the manga [Kozure Ookami](https://anilist.co/manga/30904/Kozure-Ookami/), and Koike also contributed to the scripts for the 1970s film adaptations of the series, which starred famous Japanese actor Tomisaburo Wakayama. Koike and Kojima became known as the \"Golden Duo\" because of the success of Kozure Ookami.  Another series written by Koike, [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/manga/31449/Crying-Freeman/), which was illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, was adapted into a 1995 live-action film by French director Christophe Gans.  Kazuo Koike started the Gekika Sonjuku, a college course meant to teach people how to be mangaka.\n\nIn addition to his more violent, action-oriented manga, Koike, an avid golfer, has also written golf manga.",
