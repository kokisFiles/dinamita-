  "description": "Kamiyama Samatarou is a god. But he still is a newbie god who just inherited from the former god and father, Osamu. He looks as common just as a high-school student living in a 10-year-old house in Setagaya, but he really is a god.  And the Archangel Tenko, is the one who supports Samatarou, ordinarily as a classmate, and at home also doing all the household duties of the Kamiyama family.  The two are again listening to various people&rsquo;s wishes, saving ones from their misfortune, and then wondering if what they did was a mistake. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all because you&rsquo;re telling &lsquo;Tamatarou~, sabe dat little boy~&rsquo; to him!!&rdquo; &hellip;Did they grow up after all or what. And so! He&rsquo;s still a &ldquo;Temporary License&rdquo; god!! Sorry to have kept you waiting: the new Hyper-At-Home-Comedy of the gods, finally appears.<br><br>\n(Source: Book intro)",
