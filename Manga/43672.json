  "description": "Takuma Ban, only son of the Ban familly from Hokkaido, comes to Tokyo on a quest: to find a fitting wife... with the help of Meari his cow. Jumping over a school fence while carrying Meari on his back, he unexpectedly meets a girl, Yuki Samejima. After one minute, he decides that SHE'll be his bride. Unfortunately for Takuma, Yuki's older brother, Ranmaru Samejima, is completely opposed to this.<br><br>\nOf course, the fact that Meari seems to have developed an instant \"animal\" attraction to him only reinforces Ranmaru's dislike of Takuma. Takuma is determined to make Yuki his bride and that, despite Ranmaru's stern \"objections\". Nevertheless, when not only Kei Enjouji but also Takuma's own family start getting involved, things get a little &hellip; \"chaotic\".",

Today she is one of the most popular Boys' Love authors.  Her doujinshi circle is called K2 Company. Since she got her start doing shonen manga, she was embarassed to write under her real name, so she wrote under \"Kazuma\", which is a man's name, but she decided to keep it when she started writing female-oriented stories.",
