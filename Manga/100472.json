  "description": "Kamoda will do anything to earn a quick buck, even if it means skipping out on his taxes to take his wife on a luxury cruise. But when a random tax audit bankrupts his family, Kamoda soon discovers his wife has taken that cruise after all—only without Kamoda or their daughter Kasumi.\n<br><br>\nDesperate to provide, Kamoda invests in a scheme to mass-produce masks of controversial American presidential candidate Beverly Duncan. But a lackluster election kills their sales potential, burying Kamoda under a mountain of masks and debt. On the verge of despair, Kamoda discovers a sign that leads him to the Director, an art fanatic who vows he can make all of Kamoda and Kasumi’s dreams come true.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Viz Media)",

Born in Tokyo in 1960, Urasawa debuted with BETA! in 1983 and hasn't stopped his impressive output since. Well-versed in a variety of genres, Urasawa's oeuvre encompasses a multitude of different subjects, such as a romantic comedy ([Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl](https://anilist.co/manga/30853/Yawara/)), a suspenseful human drama about a former mercenary ([Pineapple ARMY](https://anilist.co/manga/30859/Pineapple-Army/); story by [Kazuya Kudo](https://anilist.co/staff/97206/Kazuya-Kudo)), a captivating psychological suspense story ([Monster](https://anilist.co/manga/30001/Monster/)), a sci-fi adventure manga ([20th Century Boys](https://anilist.co/manga/30003/20th-Century-Boys/)), and a modern reinterpretation of the work of the God of Manga, [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/Osamu-Tezuka) ([Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka](https://anilist.co/manga/30745/Pluto/); co-authored with [Takashi Nagasaki](https://anilist.co/staff/112205/Takashi-Nagasaki), supervised by [Makoto Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/104143/Makoto-Tezuka), and with the cooperation of [Tezuka Productions](https://anilist.co/studio/200/Tezuka-Productions)). Many of his books have spawned popular animated and live-action TV programs and films, and 2008 saw the theatrical release of the first of three live-action Japanese films based on 20th Century Boys.  \n\nNo stranger to accolades and awards, Urasawa is a three-time recipient of the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award, a two-time recipient of the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, and has received the Kodansha Manga Award. Similarly, Monster has been nominated twice for the Eisner Award in America. Urasawa has also become involved in the world of academia, and in 2008 accepted a guest teaching post at Nagoya Zokei University, where he teaches courses in, of course, manga.",
