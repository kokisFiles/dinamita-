Since it occurred, she's distanced herself from her friends and family, and shows no interest in people or romance. A violinist since childhood, she's a member of her school's music club and practices every day to prepare for the quartet performance at the school cultural festival. In the midst of all this, she meets Yuusuke, a boy who took refuge in Iwaki after his family was left unable to return home following the great quake, and the two begin to fall in love...<br><br>(Source: Crunchyroll)",

His works span the transition from the classical period to the romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his \"middle\" period showed an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as \"heroic.\" During this time, he began to suffer increasingly from deafness. In his \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
