  "description": "Even though it has been a year since the Iwatobi High School Swim Club has been created, new members have yet to join the club. Now that Haruka Nanase and Makoto Tachibana are senior students, along with their younger friends Nagisa Hazuki and Rei Ryuugazaki, they have to find a way to attract new members. If not, the club will be forced to close the following year due to a lack of membership.\n<br><br>\nMeanwhile, with impending graduation, it is also time for the seniors to decide their plans for the future. Unlike their friend Rin Matsuoka, the new captain of Samezuka Academy Swim Club who is determined to fulfill his dream of being a professional swimmer, Haruka and Makoto are unsure about what career path they want to take.\n<br><br>\nFurther problems arise when an old friend of Rin's, Sousuke Yamazaki, comes to the city to study at Samezuka Academy; the recently scouted swimmer's arrival causes tension in the relationship among him, Rin, and Haruka.\n<br><br>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She worked at [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) from 2004 to 2020. \n\nYamada enjoyed drawing as a child and would copy images from the [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/) and [Dragon Ball](https://anilist.co/anime/223/) series. She joined the volleyball club in primary school and the tennis and photography clubs in high school. At the Kyoto University of Art and Design, she studied oil painting and was a member of the special effects club. She intended to work in film after university, but instead decided to join Kyoto Animation after seeing an advertisement. Her first assignment at the studio was drawing in between frames for [Inuyasha](https://anilist.co/anime/249/), which Kyoto Animation helped produce. She was eventually promoted to a key animator for [Air](https://anilist.co/anime/101/).\n\nAfter working as an episode director of [Clannad](https://anilist.co/anime/2167/), she was asked to make her chief directorial debut with [K-ON!](https://anilist.co/anime/5680/), an adaptation of a slice-of-life manga. The series was very successful, spurring a second season and a film. In 2013, she directed [Tamako Market](https://anilist.co/anime/16417/), and followed it with the film [Tamako Love Story](https://anilist.co/anime/20519/) in 2014. For Tamako Love Story, she was awarded the New Face Award at the Japan Media Arts Festival. She storyboarded the entire film herself, and also wrote the lyrics for the opening theme song, “Everybody Loves Somebody.”\n\nYamada's next project was the feature film [A Silent Voice](https://anilist.co/anime/20954/), an adaptation of [Yoshitoki Ooima](https://anilist.co/staff/105951/)’s manga by the same name. The film reflected on elements of bullying and physical impairment in Japan. The film opened at #2 in the Japanese Box Office and grossed a total of ¥2.3 billion (~$21.7m USD), the 19th highest-grossing film in Japan in 2016. The film also received multiple award nominations, including Best Animation Film in the Mainichi Film Awards and the Excellent Animation of the Year in the Japan Academy Prize.\n\nFor Yamada, the most important part of being a director is to observe people. She describes herself as a \"method\" director, emphasizing the minds of the characters.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The series was very successful, spurring a second season and a film. In 2013, she directed [Tamako Market](https://anilist.co/anime/16417/), and followed it with the film [Tamako Love Story](https://anilist.co/anime/20519/) in 2014. For Tamako Love Story, she was awarded the New Face Award at the Japan Media Arts Festival. She storyboarded the entire film herself, and also wrote the lyrics for the opening theme song, “Everybody Loves Somebody.”\n\nYamada's next project was the feature film [A Silent Voice](https://anilist.co/anime/20954/), an adaptation of [Yoshitoki Ooima](https://anilist.co/staff/105951/)’s manga by the same name. The film reflected on elements of bullying and physical impairment in Japan. The film opened at #2 in the Japanese Box Office and grossed a total of ¥2.3 billion (~$21.7m USD), the 19th highest-grossing film in Japan in 2016. The film also received multiple award nominations, including Best Animation Film in the Mainichi Film Awards and the Excellent Animation of the Year in the Japan Academy Prize.\n\nFor Yamada, the most important part of being a director is to observe people. She describes herself as a \"method\" director, emphasizing the minds of the characters.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

After entering high school, due to the uncertainty he felt towards the future, Miyano started attending singing and dance lessons he has been skipping until now. While taking music lessons, Miyano started to discover his music style through the encounter with music produced by singers like CHEMISTRY and EXILE. Miyano's first acting job was in 1992 in Tokusou Exceedraft, where he appeared in a flashback as a child in a yakuza member's past.\n\nIn 2001, he had his voice acting debut in a live action teen drama Caitlin's Way.\n\nIn 2002, he voiced Riku in the Japanese version for the video game Kingdom Hearts. Miyano also had his first anime voice acting role the same year, voicing Akira in [Shin Megami Tensei Devil Children: Light & Dark](https://anilist.co/anime/4068/). In 2003, he voiced [Kiba](https://anilist.co/character/241/), the main character in [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/). A few years later in 2006, he had what most would call his breakout role in [Death Note](https://anilist.co/anime/1535/) where he voiced the main character [Light Yagami](https://anilist.co/character/80/). For his role as Light, he was nominated for two awards at the first ever Seiyuu Awards in March 2007.\n\nOn May 28, 2007, on the King Records label, Miyano debuted as a singer with the single \"Kuon.\" The single debuted at number 47 on the Oricon charts and was used as the ending theme song for anime series [Koutetsu Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/2162/). On June 13, he released a collaboration single titled \"Fight,\" with fellow voice actress [Romi Park](https://anilist.co/staff/95082/). The duo's single debuted on the Oricon chart at number 73.\n\nIn 2008, at the second Seiyuu Awards, Miyano won \"Best Actor in a Leading Role\" for his roles [Setsuna F. Seiei](https://anilist.co/character/4234/) and [Rikuson Hakugen](https://anilist.co/character/2844/), from [Mobile Suit Gundam 00](https://anilist.co/anime/2581/) and [Koutetsu Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/2162/) respectively.
