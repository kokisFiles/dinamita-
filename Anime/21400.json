  "description": "First season of the Monogatari Series, part 4/6. Contains the arc Koyomi Vamp from the Kizumonogatari light novel.\n<br><br>\nWith help from Meme Oshino, the apparition specialist, Koyomi defeats the three powerful vampire hunters: Dramaturgy, Episode and Guillotinecutter. Koyomi takes back all the limbs of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in order to become a human again. But, when he returns to Kiss-Shot, she reveals to him the cold truth of what it means to be a vampire—a creature of the night. Unable to take back what he has done, Koyomi feels nothing but regret and can only deny his dreadful fate. While Koyomi is struggling to face reality, his “friend” Tsubasa Hanekawa comes to him with a certain plan…\n<br><br>\n(Source: Aniplex)",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/新房昭之) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Shinbo)\n\nAkiyuki Shinbou is a Japanese director, producer, animator and storyboard artist. He joined Studio One Pattern in 1981. He made his directorial debut with [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/) in 1994. He joined Shaft in 2004. He has received the 11th Tokyo Anime Award and the 2011 Newtype Anime Award for Best director for his work on the acclaimed anime series [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/).\n\nShinbou was born in Fukushima Prefecture. After high school, he attended Tokyo Designer Institute before entering the anime industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo Design Institute, Shinbou worked as an animator for the 1981 anime series [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/). Shinbou participated with Studio Pierrot in 1990 as an episode director in [Musashi](https://anilist.co/anime/8065/). His first full directorial debut was however the previously mentioned, with Metal Fighter Miku. He continued his early directional career with several OVA series in the late 90's. Shinbou participated with Seven Arcs starting with [Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever](https://anilist.co/anime/176/) in 2003 and then became director for 2004's spin-off [Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha](https://anilist.co/anime/76/).\n\nHis style in particular became noticed during his episode direction work on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/)'s Dark Tournament arc. After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies. In an interview, Kubota cited [Le Portrait de Petit Cossette](https://anilist.co/anime/514/) and [The SoulTaker](https://anilist.co/anime/1048/) among Shinbou's most distinctive products that caught his eye.\n\nHis work at Shaft has been characterized by extensive experimentation within the visual medium of animation, and often includes pictures taken from real life cut into scenes, as well as art shifts, beat panels, kabuki sound effects, textures that remain stationary when the textured object moves, showing symbols or defining parts of a character in place of characters during dialogue, written text in place (in opposition to dialogue), precise use of fan service, and \"head-tilting\", a style known as a Shaft specialty.\n\nHe says that the reason he sticks with Shaft is due to their system and professional capacity, which make his expression of direction much easier. The so-called \"Team Shinbou\" includes himself, [Tatsuya Oishi](https://anilist.co/staff/103552/) and [Shin Oonuma](https://anilist.co/staff/101753/).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Many of his cuts have the Ohira wobble. Abe has said he enjoys doing background animation and integrates it into many of his scenes.",
