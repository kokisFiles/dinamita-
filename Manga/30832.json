Trying to enroll and search the school presents Maria with a number of problems, however -- the foremost of which is: Hakuhou is an all boys school!",

She started publishing her works in 1985.     \n\nMiwa Ueda partially based the main character of Peach Girl, Momo, on herself. As a student in junior high school, she was constantly embarrassed because she tanned very easily.
