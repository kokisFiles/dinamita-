          "description": "Monkey Punch is the pen name of mangaka Kazuhiko Katou, creator of the successful Japanese manga series [Lupin III](https://anilist.co/manga/30438/), which is still being animated to this day.\n\nInfluenced by [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/)'s works, he began to draw and moved to Tokyo in 1957 after graduating from high school. From 1959, he wrote for a publishing company specializing in rental books under the pen name \"Kazuhiko Katou,\" while working on doujins with his younger brother, Teruhiko Katou, and another friend. After moving to Tokyo, he was influenced by the American parody magazine \"MAD,\" and his style changed to an American comic book style. This caught the attention of Fumito Shimizu, editor-in-chief of Futabasha, and in 1966 he made his full-fledged debut with Playboy Nyuumon under the pen name Eiji Muta. Under the name of \"Mania Group,\" it was made to look as if Senji Mashuu (摩周仙二) and Eiji Kirita (霧多永二) were participating, but in reality, Katou wrote the whole story by himself.\n\nIn 1966, under the orders of editor-in-chief Shimizu, he changed his pen name to Monkey Punch. Katou didn't like the name because it was given to a newcomer at random, and he planned to change it after about a year, but he couldn't change it because the work he published under this name the following year became a big hit.\n\nIn May 1967, he was selected to draw the cover art for \"Zengan Manga Story Action Tokushuu-gou,\" which was published mainly for newcomers to \"Manga Story,\" such as Baron Yoshimoto and Ken Tsukikage, and he continued to draw the cover art for \"Shuukan Manga Action,\" a weekly seinen manga magazine that was newly launched in August with Shimizu as editor-in-chief. He also began serializing Lupin III under the title with the notation \"Original by [Leblanc](https://anilist.co/staff/122907/).\" in the August 10 first issue of Manga Action.\n\nIn addition to Lupin III, he has also created works such as Fukushuu Daikou, [Cinderella Boy](https://anilist.co/manga/71117/), and [MUSASHI: Gundou](https://anilist.co/anime/1200/). In 1996, he took on the challenge of directing an animated film with [Lupin III: Dead or Alive](https://anilist.co/anime/1416/).\n\nHe passed away due to pneumonia on April 11, 2019.\n\n**Awards:**\n- Inkpot Award\n- Rome Comic Festival ROMICS Gold Award\n- AMD Award for Merit\n- Japan Cartoonists Association Award Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/), where he currently serves as the chief of the ufotable Art Department.\n\nWith a career spanning over 50 years in the anime industry, Ebisawa is recognized as one of the longest-serving background artists. He made his debut in 1969, contributing to the art staff of [Himitsu no Akko-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/3285/Himitsu-no-Akkochan/). Over the years, Ebisawa freelanced for various studios, leaving his artistic mark on iconic scenes in productions like [Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone](https://anilist.co/anime/1435/Lupin-III-The-Secret-of-Mamo/), [Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/Macross-Do-You-Remember-Love/), and others.\n\nIn 1980, he took on the role of art director for [Cyborg 009: Legend of the Super Galaxy](https://anilist.co/anime/7336/Cyborg-009-Legend-of-the-Super-Galaxy/), initiating a career in art direction for theatrical and OVA productions. Despite his reluctance for the position, he continued to contribute to notable works. After a hiatus from the role, he returned as art director for [The Garden of Sinners: Chapter 4 – The Hollow Shrine](https://anilist.co/anime/4280/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-4-garannodou-The-Hollow-Shrine/) in 2008.\n\nEbisawa's unique approach includes hand-drawing backgrounds using traditional methods like paper, brushes, and poster colors, a style that distinguishes him in an era dominated by digital techniques. Notably, he personally handled the majority of cuts in The Garden of Sinners: Chapter 4 – The Hollow Shrine.\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 65, Ebisawa expanded his role by taking on the position of art director for the anime series [Today's Menu for the Emiya Family](https://anilist.co/anime/100855/Todays-Menu-for-the-Emiya-Family/). His contributions extend beyond individual projects, as he plays a crucial role in training new talents at ufotable, As part of the training program for new staff, they are obliged to work exclusively on hand-drawn background art using poster colors, similar to Ebisawa's style, for a certain period after joining the company. This practice aims to improve the drawing skills of the art staff, resulting in the inclusion of hand-drawn backgrounds in many ufotable works. Throughout his career, Ebisawa's dedication to the artistry of animation has left an indelible mark on the industry.",
