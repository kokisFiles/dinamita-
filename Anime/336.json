  "description": "The first season begins with introducing the characters, their past and their ambitions. Orpherus, Eduard, Camus, Lui and Naoji are five noblemen who attend the prestigious Rozenstolz academy, and who are a part of the Strahl class &ndash; a class for potential candidates for the advisory positions in the royal palace in the small European country of Kuchen. Isaac is an English writer who visits Kuchen. While still students, the five noblemen are forced to deal with corrupted politicians, secret agents, attempted murder and ambitious individuals from both inside and outside of school who threatens to break the fragile peace in their country, and even assassinate the king.",

          "description": "Kouichi Mashimo is a well-known Japanese anime director and the founder of the animation studio Bee Train. Since the creation of the studio, Mashimo directed or otherwise participated in (nearly) all its works, for example, as a member of art or sound department.\n\nMashimo was born in Tokyo, Japan and from his early years showed interest in photography, admittedly under the influence of his father. Mashimo studied jurisprudence at Sophia University and during his fourth university year, he participated in the making of several television commercials. However, this was a rather disappointing experience, and on November 6, 1975, he applied for a position of Hiroshi Sasagawa's assistant director in Tatsunoko Production. The first anime series he worked on was Time Bokan (1975–76).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, while still working for Tatsunoko, Mashimo survived a severe alpine skiing accident. During his stay in an intensive care unit, he came up with an idea of a \"hospital for animators\", an animation studio whose primary goal would be fostering and self-actualization of talented artists rather than commercial success and money. Some time after that, he founded a small freelance studio called Mashimo Jimusho that was mainly producing in-between animation for larger companies. In 1997, Mashimo presented his studio-as-hospital concept to Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, the president of Production I.G, who was so impressed with it that he immediately agreed to sponsor Mashimo. The new subsidiary has become known as Bee Train and in February 2006, it ended its relationship with I.G and became independent.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He first started out in the industry in 1997 as a production assistant at JCF. Amazingly, he has never been formally trained in art. His talent for drawing was first discovered through various doodles and sketches he would make on company paperwork.\n\nYamashita's first project as an animator was on [the second Kochikame movie](https://anilist.co/anime/3547/). Some time later he went freelance. [Samurai Champloo](https://anilist.co/anime/205/) was the first project he worked on freelance. Around 2006, Yamashita joined [Bee Train](https://anilist.co/studio/5/) and started work as character designer and animation director on the TV show [Ginyuu Mokushiroku Meine Liebe Wieder](https://anilist.co/anime/771/). A short while later, the animation department at Bee Train was spun off into new company, [C-Station](https://anilist.co/studio/6074/), and Yamashita moved with it.
