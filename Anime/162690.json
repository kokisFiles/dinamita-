She started playing piano when she was 5 years old. After graduating from KOYO SCHOOL OF MUSIC（current・KOYO SCHOOL OF MUSIC&DANCE), she went to study abroad in Boston, then graduated from Berklee College of Music with a Bachelor of Music in Jazz composition and a Bachelor of Music in Performance. In 2006, \"Nichiyomachi (Waiting for Sunday)\" which would become her 2nd single, was on air at the J-WAVE radio audition program \"RADIO SAKAMOTO\" navigated by Ryuichi Sakamoto, then she performed in \"LOHAS CLASSIC Concert\" also produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto. In the same year, she released \"Konnichiwa mata ashita (Hello & See you)” produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto as her debut single in Japan. Since then, she has released 11 solo albums and 7 soundtrack albums. The latest solo album is “Ame no hakoniwa (My garden in the rain)” released in 2017. She composed the whole score in a long-running hit animated movie “Konosekai no Katasumi ni (In This Corner of the World)” released in November 2016, which led to her winning the 40th Japan Academy Film Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Music, the 71st Mainichi Film Awards for Best Music, and Best Music Award in the Osaka Cinema Festival 2017. Music of “In This Corner of the World” Concert, which represented the movie in a music concert, was well-received all over the country. At present, she has earned a high reputation as a singer-songwriter, composer and pianist with works on soundtracks for movies, dramas, animations, and commercials, and has a deeper expression of orchestra arrangements as well as performances. In recent years, the range of her voice expressions has expanded, including narration. In 2018, she visited Argentina on her first overseas tour, making all six performances a huge success and gained worldwide acclaim. She is now active as an artist who draws a pop world full of floating feelings with outstanding piano performance and soft singing voice.",
