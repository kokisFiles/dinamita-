  "description": "The show starts with the tale of Chitose Fujinomiya, a girl who goes from riches to rags and back and remains a snob despite it all. When her wealthy father dies, remaining debts leave Chitose almost broke, and she is kicked out of the affluent Tokai no Gakuen, or City Academy. She is left with nothing in the world but the clothes on her back and one pink goldfish named Gyopi-chan, the only memento she has of her father. Wandering lost, she collapses on the grounds of the poor-but-happy Inaka no Chugakko (Country Jr. High School), where the students are rough if friendly, and farm animals regularly roam the school grounds and even attend class. Recovering, she enters into the school but is repelled by its air of poverty, to which she is unaccustomed.  <br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

He was formerly associated with [TYO Animations](https://anilist.co/studio/333/), formerly known as [Hal Film Maker](https://anilist.co/studio/34/).\n\nSatou’s first major work was directing the first, and a portion of the second season of [Sailor Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/530/) for [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/), after which he handed the position over to [Kunihiko Ikuhara](https://anilist.co/staff/100082/), although he continued to storyboard and direct episodes for the later seasons. Satou later went on to co-direct [Ojamajo Doremi](https://anilist.co/anime/350/) alongside [Takuya Igarashi](https://anilist.co/staff/105087/), as well as the critically acclaimed [Princess Tutu](https://anilist.co/anime/721/). Satou served as chief director for long-runner [Sgt.

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ikuni_noise/) | [Website](https://ikuni.net)\n\n**Kunihiko Ikuhara**, nicknamed Ikuni, was born December 21, 1964 in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. Ikuhara is an idiosyncratic, postmodern anime director that had a significant impact on the development of anime styles from the 90s and onward. His surrealist, psychosexual works are why fans often compare him to [David Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch). Although he is a beloved creative mind, Ikuhara is very hard to deal with and is an overwhelming perfectionist, leading to a small, but important catalog of work. \n\n**Style**\nIkuhara is an incredibly unique artist, but draws a lot of influence from [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki), making interesting anime that focuses on maximal impact on minimal drawings. Key examples would be [*Onii-sama e...*](https://anilist.co/anime/795/Oniisama-e/) and [*Versailles no Bara*](https://anilist.co/anime/338/Versailles-no-Bara/). Their directing also show similarities in how they try to provoke feelings from the viewer. One particular recurring trait would be [their Dutch angles](https://aninomiyako.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/obliqueness.jpg?w=500&h=561), which is used to depict unrest and disorientation. \n\nIkuhara's usual stylistic and narrative devices include pretense, deception, metaphors, bluffs, and repetition of gags. His iconography is consistent to the point people made [humorous bingo's](https://i.imgur.com/vlVmMu6.jpg) for his works. His enthusiasm and history with theater led to his most apparent stylistic trait, namely a stage play-like presentation with a mise-en-scène policy of showing only what is necessary, maintaining a tight control of his canvas at all times. Images themselves become a strong narrative tool. The themes of his work often tackle adolescence and LGBTQ-issues and turns them into cartoonish fables that gets to the heart of the issues.\n\n",

          "description": "Takanori Arisawa was a Japanese composer and arranger from Tokyo. He wrote the background music for several notable anime, including the award-winning soundtrack of the Sailor Moon anime series.    He died of bladder cancer at 54 years of age.    As the Music Director for Sailor Moon, Arisawa's first award was the 1993 Golden Disk Grand Prize from Columbia Records. He continued to compose for the entire anime series, plus several video games and some of the stage musicals. In 1998, 2000, and 2001 he won the JASRAC International Award for most international royalties, owing largely to the popularity of Sailor Moon music in other nations.    Arisawa expressed an admiration of Hollywood-style music, drawing his initial inspiration for the tone of the Sailor Moon soundtrack from the Charlie's Angels TV series. He frequently made use of symbolism when writing themes for specific characters or groups, borrowing thematic elements from diverse genres and from other countries. As the series progressed, his music gravitated from a pop feeling toward more classical arrangements to represent the protagonist having passed through painful experiences and grown as a person.

          "description": "Takamura Mukuo was a famous art director from Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan. He was a graduate of Musashino Art University, where he majored in Western Painting. After graduating in 1963, Mukuo joined Tokyo Movie Studio and started his career as a background artist for animation. In 1966, he established his own studio, Mukuo Group and Mukuo Studio in 1968, which was incorporated three years later in 1971.\n\nSome of his best known works include the feature film [Cello Hiki no Gauche](https://anilist.co/anime/1049/) and [Haha o Tazunete Sanzenri](https://anilist.co/anime/1663/), part of the WMT series, both directed by [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/). For the latter he visited actual places in Italy and Argentina together with Takahata and Miyazaki, to ensure an authentic feel to the series.\n\nHe was also known for his contribution to science-fiction anime franchises [Uchuu Senkan Yamato](https://anilist.co/anime/1650/), [Uchuu Kaizoku Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/) and [Ginga Tetsudou 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/).\n\nHe was awarded the first grand-prix of the first anime popularity contest in the category of art, which was organised by the publisher Tokuma-Shoten. The contest was won by Mukuo five times in a row, until it was cancelled, making him the only winner in the art category.\n\nMukuo had greatly contributed to the rapid development of the animation in Japan during the 1970s and 80s.\n\nHe passed away from cancer on June 9, 1992 at the age of 54. At that time he was working on the [Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/530/) series. [Tadao Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/154564/) took over his place but Mukuo was still credited as art designer of the Sailor Moon series subsequently for all later works.\n\nTadao Kubota, who was a manager at the Mukuo Studio, took also over Mukuo's duties as representative director of the studio.\n\nIn April 2004 a book that collected all of his best works was released posthumously. Titled Takamura Mukuo: The Art of Animation and supervised by Keiko Mukuo and Tadao Kubota, it does include much of Mukuo's background art, image boards, and plans to masterpieces like Ginga Tetsudou 999, Haha o Tazunete Sanzenri, [Neo Tokyo](https://anilist.co/anime/1951/), Cello Hiki no Gauche, Sailor Moon and [Kamui no Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/496/).",

He was formerly associated with [TYO Animations](https://anilist.co/studio/333/), formerly known as [Hal Film Maker](https://anilist.co/studio/34/).\n\nSatou’s first major work was directing the first, and a portion of the second season of [Sailor Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/530/) for [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/), after which he handed the position over to [Kunihiko Ikuhara](https://anilist.co/staff/100082/), although he continued to storyboard and direct episodes for the later seasons. Satou later went on to co-direct [Ojamajo Doremi](https://anilist.co/anime/350/) alongside [Takuya Igarashi](https://anilist.co/staff/105087/), as well as the critically acclaimed [Princess Tutu](https://anilist.co/anime/721/).
