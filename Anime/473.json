  "description": "The catastrophe, \"Hammer of Eden\", resulted in the loss of six billion lives and the flooding of 90% of the land. The New United Nations were formed to pursue peace on the ruined lands 14 years later. Keel is a boy living in a town called Yabitsu, an area which prospered due to the energy from the nuclear generator brought by the catastrophe. His next kin, Aoi, is the secretary general of the New United Nations. She views the catastrophe as an opportunity to create a new world in which nations can help one another overcome differences in races and religions. However, her efforts to realise that vision fail because of the unwillingness of the nations to change. Gould, a military officer, feels that the only way to make an order is through the military. Using Ulysses, a nuclear submarine, along with his crew, including Keel's brother Tean, Gould carries out a coup to declare war against the New United Nations in his attack on Yabitsu.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

After Bevore's dissolution, he joined Atelier Giga, and from there he joined Project Team Muu. There he was jointly in charge of the character designs, animation direction and storyboards for [Giant Robo the Animation: The Day the Earth Stood Still](https://anilist.co/anime/2321/). The production took nearly 10 years, during which Yamashita gave it his all. After the production was over he started losing his motivation for animation. Though, it sparked again, after having met [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on the opening animation for a video game called, Gensou Suikogaiden. \n\nIn 2001, Yamashita worked as a key animator on [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/), a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) feature film. There he was in charge of multiple scenes, most notably Chihiro and Haru's free fall at the end of the movie. This earned him high high praise from [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), and he was thus selected as one of the animation director's for [How's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/). Since then he has served as an animation director on most of Ghibli's movies.\n\nIn 2018, Yamashita directed \"The Invisible Man,\" a short film part of the anthology collection [Modest Heroes](https://anilist.co/anime/103887/), produced by [Studio Ponoc](https://anilist.co/studio/6147/). The film won the Newcomer's Award in the Animation Division at the 22nd Japan Media Arts Festival\n\nMarried to [Miho Shimogasa](https://anilist.co/staff/116279/).",
