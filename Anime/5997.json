          "description": "Shotaro Ishinomori was an influential figure in manga, anime and tokusatsu who created several immensely popular long-running series such as Cyborg 009, what would go on to become the Super Sentai series and the Kamen Rider Series. He was twice awarded by the Shogakukan Manga Award, in 1968 for Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae and in 1988 for Hotel and Manga Nihon Keizai Nyumon. He was born and named <b>Shotaro Onodera</b> (小野寺 章太郎) in Tome, Miyagi, and was also known as Shotaro Ishimori (石森 章太郎) before 1986, when he changed his family name to Ishinomori with \"ノ\".  \n\nCyborg 009, created in 1963, became the first superpowered hero team created in Japan. That same year, Kazumasa Hirai and Jiro Kuwata created Japan's first cyborg superhero, 8 Man (which predated Kamen Rider by eight years). The success of the tokusatsu superhero TV series Kamen Rider, produced by Toei Company Ltd. in 1971, led to the birth of the \"Transforming\" (henshin) superhero (human-sized superheroes who transform by doing a pose, and use martial arts to fight henchmen and the weekly monster), and resulted in many sequel shows to this day. Ishinomori then created many similar superhero dramas, which were once again all produced by Toei or in Sarutobi Ecchan's case Toei Animation, including Android Kikaider , Henshin Ninja Arashi, Inazuman, Robotto Keiji, Secret Task Force Goranger (the first Super Sentai series), Kaiketsu Zubat, Akumaizer 3, Sarutobi Ecchan, the Toei Fushigi Comedy Series and countless others. He even created popular children's shows such as Hoshi no Ko Chobin (Chobin, Child of the Stars, 1974, a co-production with Studio Zero which was a major success on Italian television), and Ganbare!! Robokon.    \n\nIshinomori's art is quite reminiscent of that of his mentor, Osamu Tezuka. The true story of his first meeting with Tezuka was illustrated in a short four-page tale drawn up as supplementary material for the 1970s Astro Boy manga reprints. Around 1955, Ishinomori submitted work to a contest seeking new talent in the magazine, Manga Shonen. Tezuka was impressed by his drawings and asked Ishinomori to help him with Astro Boy. In the American release, this story can be seen in Volume 15, along with Ishinomori's earliest work on the \"Electro\" story arc.    \n\nIshinomori also illustrated a comic adaptation of the Super NES video game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, which was produced for the American publication Nintendo Power. The comic consisted of 12 chapters, which were serialized from January 1992 (Volume 32) to December 1992 (Volume 43). The comic was republished as a graphic novel collection in 1993.  Ishinomori died of heart failure on January 28, 1998 just 3 days after his 60th birthday. His final work was the tokusatsu superhero TV series, Voicelugger, televised a year later. Two years later, the Kamen Rider Series would be revived with Kamen Rider Kuuga. All of the series made in the Heisei period credit Ishinomori as the creator. The Ishinomori Manga Museum named in his honor opened in Ishinomaki, Miyagi in 2001.[2] Special trains in the Senseki Line were commissioned featuring his artwork generally leading to the museum.    \n\nHis work posthumously awarded him the Guinness World Record for most comics published by one author, totaling over 128,000 pages.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)          ",

          "description": "Shigeyuki Hayashi, better known by his pseudonym Rintarou, is a well-known anime director.\n\nA film buff ever since he was a kid, he wanted to pursue a career in filmmaking. After having worked as a cel painter in commercial animation, he joined [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/) in 1958 for a brief time working on films such as [Hakujaden](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and [Saiyuuki](https://anilist.co/anime/4481/). After having been told that he couldn't work as a director due to not being a college graduate, he moved to [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) - making his directorial debut as one of the regular episode directors on [Tetsuwan Atom](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/).\n\nIn 1972, Rintarou left Mushi Pro to go freelance and to co-found [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11) together with [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/). A few years later, Rintarou got invited to direct [Jetter Mars](https://anilist.co/anime/6087/) at his previously disinterested workplace, Toei Animation. He accepted the offer but didn't join the studio as an employee, making him one of the few people who've directed for the studio while not being an inhouse employee. He continued to direct multiple entries for Toei, including [Arrow Emblem](https://anilist.co/anime/3800/), [Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/), as well as the 1979 film [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1301/), which is still considered by many as his best work.\n\n[Haruki Kadokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170354/), the president of [Kadokawa Shoten](https://anilist.co/studio/113/), took notice of the commercial success of Rintarou's works and hired him to direct [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/), which was the very first film produced by Kadokawa. The animation production was handled by Madhouse, where Rintarou changed his post at this time. There he continued his directorial efforts with numerous films and OVA series.\n\nThe older brother of [Masayuki Hayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/161046/).",

          "description": "Legendary sakuga animator critical to the development of Japanese TV animation. No less than Yoshinori Kanada and Masaaki Yuasa have cited him as an influence.\n\nDidn’t fit the nerdy animator stereotype in his youth. Growing up Kimura was known as a tough guy, bulky and confrontational. However, he loved painting as a hobby and when he couldn’t get into his art college of choice he joined Toei as an animator. Mentored by Yasuo Otsuka. Even in his earliest drawings, Kimura was extremely idiosyncratic: his lineart was rough and sketchy, but at the same time he paid more attention to human anatomy than all of his peers. Kimura’s cuts stood out for their rawness and epitomized the tendency in early TV anime towards highly stylized individual drawings in lieu of full animation.\n\nA staple of Toei’s early experiments in TV animation. He was animation director and character designer for both the television and film incarnations of Cyborg 009 and animated the OP. He served a similar role on Rainbow Sentai Robin. Kimura’s masterpiece was his character designs and animation direction on Toei’s breakthrough wrestling series Tiger Mask. Kimura personally animated the OP and was AD on a number of episodes (1, 7, 11, 21, 27, 36, 49, 51, 58, 64, 71, 82). His drawings were inspired by the bold, expressionistic movie poster illustrations of Bob Peak.\n\nFollowing Tiger Mask, Kimura animated for a number of major 70s anime. He was often typecasted for OPs, like those he did for Atack No. 1 and Gatchaman. He was also a regular animator on the first Lupin III TV anime. After leaving Toei he formed his own subcontracting studio Neo Media and spent most of his career from the 80s onward training younger animators, though he still animates from time to time.\n\nRecently participated in a kickstarter, Go Samurai, which intends to make a short film out of Kimura’s uncorrected B&W pencil drawings.\n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/keiichiro-kimura/)",

          "description": "Suzuki Shinichi is a supervisor, director and mangaka from Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. He lived with the manga artists of the legendary Tokiwa-So before starting his career as an animator at Otogi Pro. He was one of the founders of Studio Zero along with Fujio Akatsuka and Shotaro Ishinomori, a short-lived studio that nonetheless created shows like Rainbow Sentai Robin and nurtured animators like Keiichiro Kimura (木村圭市郎). He took part in at least the last Animation Festival with the short Dot (点), and went on to take part in films like Space Firebird 2772 and Legend of the Forest and Yuki before focusing on educational films.\n\nWhile his most active time was in the 60s-80s he has been making short stints in the recent decade as well. In 2001 he worked on NHK's claymation series Chikkun Takku (チックン・タック) and in 2003 he provided a warm and memorable short to Kawamoto Kihachirou's Winter Days.\n\nHe is also the director emeritus of Suginami Animation Museum.\n\n<i>Notes:\n-Not to be confused with the Magic Bus animator [Suzuki Shinichi](https://anilist.co/staff/153784/Shinichi-Suzuki) by the same name.\n-Not to be confused with animator, director and Anime Koubou Basara founder [Suzuki Shinichi](https://anilist.co/staff/116319) by a different kanji name.</i>",
