  "description": "Toki Meka was originally Takeuchi Naoko's first manga after a hiatus of nearly four years. It appeared as a yomikiri in the September 2001 issue of Nakayoshi. At the end was a note requesting letters from people who would like to see a continuation, but shortly after, Takeuchi started the unrelated manga Love Witch.<br><br>\nThe story is about Hoshiko finally creating the perfect robot girl doll!<br><br>\nWhen Mimii was young, she was friends with Hoshiko. Hoshiko had to go to the United States because she was studying abroad. Mimii makes Hoshiko promise that they will always be friends. And this is where the story starts.<br><br>\nMeca shows up in Mimii's life 7 years later to become her friend, and to help her. However, Meca isn't exactly all that Mimii thought she would be. Meca keeps getting into trouble, saving people's lives, and summoning various people/robots/objects with her cellphone.\n",
