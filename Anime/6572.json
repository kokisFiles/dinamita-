The anime Future GPX Cyber Formula (1991) and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing (1995) and several films in the Gamera series are some of his most well-known works.

Other notable scores by Otani include Outlaw Star (1998), Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz (1998), Cross Fire (2000), The SoulTaker (2001), Haibane Renmei (2002), Zatch Bell! (2003), Eyeshield 21 (2005), Pumpkin Scissors (2006), Deltora Quest (2007), and Over Drive (2007). He has also been the music director and keyboardist of the band Dreams Come True. He appeared at Eminence Symphony Orchestra's events A Night in Fantasia 2007: Symphonic Games Edition and Unearthing Eden ~The sounds of AINARU~ in 2007.  \n\nThroughout his career, Otani has also composed music for several video games, making his debut with the 1995 shooter game Philosoma. In 2000, he created the soundtrack to the flight simulator Sky Odyssey. He scored Shadow of the Colossus in 2005, his most famous video game work. Otani was responsible for composing the music for Wild Arms: Twilight Venom (2000), an anime adaptation of the Wild Arms video game series; he also arranged compositions of Michiko Naruke's music from the series. He did two more video game to anime adaptations: Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (1997) and Popolocrois Monogatari (1998). In 2005, he created the track \"Madness\" alongside Hiroko Shigezumi for the Square Enix game Heavy Metal Thunder.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/numa_milky)\n\nNumata is best known for his strongly distorted character style and peculiar sense for timing, often being named as an animator of the [Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/) school. He tends to work together with character designer [Kyuuta Sakai](https://anilist.co/staff/106111/), whose disproportionated character designs particularly fit his style, employing often large teardrops, which brought him to spotlight in [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni](https://anilist.co/anime/934/). The duo also participated together in several other shows, such as [Ichigo Mashimaro](https://anilist.co/anime/488/) and [Strawberry Panic](https://anilist.co/anime/855/).\n\nEvery now and then works under one of his many pseudonyms.\n\n(Source: Anidb)",
