  "description": "The Western Planet and the Eastern Planet. Once upon a time, the two sides were bound by the \"Dragon Pulse\" spanning the heavens. The civilization that once had prospered has now turned to a tale of dreams, as the inextinguishable flames of war tear the realm asunder. The two planets remain engulfed in endless battles. The return of the super technology known as \"sacred treasures\" could revolutionize the world order, but no one knows of them but one person—a \"heretical girl.\"\nA girl from the Western Planet, Jeanne Kaguya d'Arc, saw heavenly visions of the birth of a \"Star Messiah\" who will save the world. She embarks on a journey to the Eastern Planet with Leonardo da Vinci, \"the one who observes the world.\" They come across the heretic of the Eastern Planet and \"the greatest fool of the day,\" Oda Nobunaga.\n\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)\n<br><br>\n<u>Note</u>:\nFrom Volume 2 onwards the plot changes drastically from the Anime version.",

          "description": "Shouji Kawamori is an anime creator, director and mechanical designer. Also a current advisor for [Satelight](https://anilist.co/studio/41/).\n\nFamous for his work in the [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) and Transformers franchises. He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",
