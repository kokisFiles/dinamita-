          "description": "[Website](http://joehisaishi.com/) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxyzciBLt1Hyw06dlqwAIkw) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/official_joeh) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joehisaishi.official/)\n\nMamoru Fujisawa, known professionally as Joe Hisaishi, is a Japanese composer and musical director known for over 100 film scores and solo albums dating back to 1981. He has been associated with filmmaker [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) since 1984, having composed scores for all but one of his films. Hisaishi is also widely known for his piano scores.\n\nWhile possessing a stylistically distinct sound, Hisaishi's music has been known to explore and incorporate different genres, including minimalist, experimental electronic, European classical, and Japanese classical. Lesser known are the other musical roles he plays; he is also a typesetter, author, arranger, and conductor. Hisaishi was a student of composer [Takeo Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/106839/).\n\nHisaishi started learning violin in the Violin School Suzuki Shinichi at the age of four, he found his passion in music. At the same age, he also began watching 300 movies a year with his father, which influenced his career. Realizing his love, he attended the Kunitachi College of Music in 1969 to major in music composition. Hisaishi collaborated with minimalist artists as a typesetter, furthering his experience in the musical world.\n\nHe enjoyed his first success of the business in 1974 when he composed music for the anime series called [Gyatoruzu](https://anilist.co/anime/8763/). This and other early works were created under his given name. He presented his first public performance in the mid '70s, spreading his name around his community.\n\nIn 1983, Hisaishi was recommended to create an image album for [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/). Hisaishi and the director of the animated film, Hayao Miyazaki, became great friends and would work together on many future projects. In 1985, he founded his own recording studio—the wonder station. Their collaboration has invited comparisons to the collaborations of Steven Spielberg and John Williams. This big break led to Hisaishi's overwhelming success as a composer of film scores. In 1986, [Laputa: Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/) would be the first feature to appear under the [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) banner, and its gentle, faintly melancholic tone would become a familiar trademark of much of the studio's later output. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding anime industry's top musical contributors, his compositions would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the '80s and '90s.\n\nHisaishi formulated an alias inspired by Quincy Jones, an African-American musician and producer. Re-transcribed in Japanese, \"Quincy Jones\" became \"Joe Hisaishi\". (\"Quincy\", pronounced \"Kuinshī” in Japanese, can be written using the same kanji in \"Hisaishi\"; \"Joe\" comes from \"Jones\".)\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He has been associated with filmmaker [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) since 1984, having composed scores for all but one of his films. Hisaishi is also widely known for his piano scores.\n\nWhile possessing a stylistically distinct sound, Hisaishi's music has been known to explore and incorporate different genres, including minimalist, experimental electronic, European classical, and Japanese classical. Lesser known are the other musical roles he plays; he is also a typesetter, author, arranger, and conductor. Hisaishi was a student of composer [Takeo Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/106839/).\n\nHisaishi started learning violin in the Violin School Suzuki Shinichi at the age of four, he found his passion in music. At the same age, he also began watching 300 movies a year with his father, which influenced his career. Realizing his love, he attended the Kunitachi College of Music in 1969 to major in music composition. Hisaishi collaborated with minimalist artists as a typesetter, furthering his experience in the musical world.\n\nHe enjoyed his first success of the business in 1974 when he composed music for the anime series called [Gyatoruzu](https://anilist.co/anime/8763/). This and other early works were created under his given name. He presented his first public performance in the mid '70s, spreading his name around his community.\n\nIn 1983, Hisaishi was recommended to create an image album for [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/). Hisaishi and the director of the animated film, Hayao Miyazaki, became great friends and would work together on many future projects. In 1985, he founded his own recording studio—the wonder station. Their collaboration has invited comparisons to the collaborations of Steven Spielberg and John Williams. This big break led to Hisaishi's overwhelming success as a composer of film scores. In 1986, [Laputa: Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/) would be the first feature to appear under the [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) banner, and its gentle, faintly melancholic tone would become a familiar trademark of much of the studio's later output. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding anime industry's top musical contributors, his compositions would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the '80s and '90s.\n\nHisaishi formulated an alias inspired by Quincy Jones, an African-American musician and producer.

          "description": "__Residency:__ Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan\n__Graduated:__ Gakushuin University (Department of Economics)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, script/screenwriter, author, mangaka and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He is the second of four brothers, and was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyou Ward. He is best known for his international fame as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of astonishing animated feature films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\n\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014, as well as having won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature, the only instances in which a non-English-language film has won the award. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n__Biography:__\nMiyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, which led to him eventually joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation) in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with the director [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/Isao-Takahata). Some notable films Miyazaki contributed to at Toei include [Doggie March](https://anilist.co/anime/9228/Wan-Wan-Chuushingura/) and [Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/2833/Gullivers-Travels-Beyond-the-Moon/). He provided key animation in other films at Toei, such as the Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to animation studio A-Pro in 1971, where he would co-direct the movie Lupin the Third Part I alongside Isao Takahata. After moving to Zuiyou Eizou (later dubbed [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/Nippon-Animation)) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/Future-Boy-Conan/). He joined [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/Telecom-Animation-Film)/Tokyo Movie Shinsa in 1979 to direct his first feature films, [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/) in 1979 and [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/) in 1984, as well as the television series [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/Sherlock-Hound/).\n\nMiyazaki co-founded [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/Studio-Ghibli) in 1985. He would go on to direct numerous of films with Ghibli, including [Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/Castle-in-the-Sky/) (1986), [My Neighbor Totoro](https://anilist.co/anime/523/My-Neighbor-Totoro/) (1988), [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/Kikis-Delivery-Service/) (1989), and [Porco Rosso](https://anilist.co/anime/416/Porco-Rosso/) (1992). The films they made were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. His film [Princess Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/Princess-Mononoke/) was the first animated film to ever win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and it briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997, and its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Studio Ghibli's popularity and influence outside of Japan. His 2001 film [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/Spirited-Away/) became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films, [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/) (2004), [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/Ponyo/) (2008), and [The Wind Rises](https://anilist.co/anime/16662/The-Wind-Rises/) (2013) also enjoyed critical and commercial success.\n\nFollowing the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned again in 2016 to work on a new feature film, [The Boy and The Heron](https://anilist.co/anime/109979/The-Boy-and-the-Heron/) (2023). The film received critical acclaim, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and the second non-English-language film, after Spirited Away, to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards. According to Studio Ghibli vice-president [Junichi Nishioka](https://anilist.co/staff/212700/Junichi-Nishioka) and long-time colleague, [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/Toshio-Suzuki), Miyazaki is reportedly working on another feature film, contrary to rumours that The Boy and the Heron would be his last.",

Upon graduating from university, Okamura joined the animation production studio Madhouse as an animator through the recommendation of a friend. Lensman was the first series he worked on as an animator. The first anime movies that he worked on were Kamui no Ken and Bobby ni Kubittake. \n\nIn 1989, he made his debut as an episode director with Yawara! and soon made his full directorial debut in 1995 with Memories. He later left Madhouse and went freelance, working on several projects along the way.\n\nIn 1991, he changed his first name from Yutaka to Tensai.",

          "description": "A highly prolific and an extremely influential animator.\n\nKnow for his experimentation with the timing of keyframes, his dynamic poses, and his peculiar effects Kanada pioneered a number of techniques and concepts that permeated and shaped the Japanese animation industry, influencing not only his peers but also the generations to come.\n\nKanada's ability and his tendency to be very personal with his drawings, even to the point of ignoring storyboards if the situation required, popularized in the industry the concept of letting the individual animator's talents shine instead of being uniformed into anonymity. This precept is still respected today and it's one of the reasons Japanese animation is so distinctly unique. His career is also a testament to his ethos that expressive and vibrant animation is not achieved simply through increasing the number of frames but through playing with movement, poses and timing.\n\nIn the early '00s, Kanada became an employee at Square Enix.\n\nNotable Square Enix titles in which he was credited:\n\n~!\n- 2002, Final Fantasy XI (Motion Capture, Animation Director)\n- 2005, Musashiden II: Blade Master (Storyboard)\n- 2006, Dawn of Mana (Facial Setting)\n- 2007, Final Fantasy 4 DS Version (Storyboard)\n- 2009, Final Fantasy XIII (Storyboard Director) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2011, Final Fantasy XIII-2 (Storyboard) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2012, Dragon Quest X (Storyboard)  - *Posthumous credit.* !~",
