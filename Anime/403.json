  "description": "After losing his mother, 12-year-old Taro journeys to Tokyo to live with his grandfather. But he gets the biggest surprise when he discovers that his grandfather's home is a huge mansion with hundreds of beautiful maids ready to serve him. Making matters worse (at least for Taro, but not for our viewing) is that not only does he inherit the Hanaukyo mansion, he gets the services of all of the maids 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

She is a member of the voice acting unit Drops, which included fellow voice actresses Mariko Kouda, Akemi Kanda, Ai Nonaka and Ryoko Shiraishi and of the voice acting unit SD-Children along with Miyu Matsuki.\n\nHer casting is usually that of a young child, due to her high-pitched voice.
