  "description": "Noel Tsukioka wants to be a simple, normal high school girl who has friends and falls in love with the man of her dreams. However, Noel leads a very abnormal life. At age 15, she&rsquo;s the All Japan Junior Champion at figure skating. Her mom is also her coach, and is very strict on Noel about focusing solely on her figure skating, and not to concern herself with trivial matters like friends and love. She&rsquo;s also one of the most popular girls at school. Noel also bypassed going to a regular school, in favor of going to the prestigious Yotsuba Academy, where her older brother Naoto teaches at. Secretly, Noel has feelings for her older brother.<br><br>\nBut, as Noel will learn.. Sometimes life can be complicated, and Noel will face challenges in the form of rivals both on the skating rink, and for her brother. Not to mention, her feelings for her brother are of the forbidden kind..\n",
