The only reoccurring member is the vocalist, who is only known as an unindentified woman going by the stage name \"ACA-NE\" (pronounced Akane). It can additionally be noted that their secrecy is a contributing factor to their popularity.\n\n__Biography:__\nZutomayo debuted by releasing their first song \"Byoushin wo Kamu\" on YouTube on June 4, 2018. The song became an immediate hit on release, garnering 200,000 views within its first week on the platform. Additionally, after releasing the single through streaming platforms on August 30, the song became the most streamed song that week. Following their song's release, Zutomayo held their first concert at the Daikanyama Loop in Tokyo. Attendees were handed opaque glasses and reported that the entire venue was dark for the duration of the concert. The group would continue to conceal their identities in future concerts as well.\n\nZutomayo released two more singles digitally before releasing their first EP, Tadashii Itsuwari Kara no Kishou, on November 14 in the same year, through record label EMI Records Japan. The EP peaked 8th on the Oricon Albums Chart and was nominated in the 19th CD Shop Awards. On June 5, 2019, a second EP was released titled Imawa Imade Chikaiwa Emide, which peaked at the number one spot on the Oricon chart. Later in that same year on October 30, they would release their first full-length album titled Hisohiso Banashi.\n\n__Members:__\n- [ACA-NE](https://anilist.co/staff/170316/ACANE) (ACAね, Akane) – vocalist, in-charge of lyrics and composition\n\n(Source: [Wikipedia (JP)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%9A%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8%E7%9C%9F%E5%A4%9C%E4%B8%AD%E3%81%A7%E3%81%84%E3%81%84%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AB%E3%80%82), edited)",

The only reoccurring member is the vocalist, who is only known as an unindentified woman going by the stage name \"ACA-NE\" (pronounced Akane). It can additionally be noted that their secrecy is a contributing factor to their popularity.\n\n__Biography:__\nZutomayo debuted by releasing their first song \"Byoushin wo Kamu\" on YouTube on June 4, 2018. The song became an immediate hit on release, garnering 200,000 views within its first week on the platform. Additionally, after releasing the single through streaming platforms on August 30, the song became the most streamed song that week. Following their song's release, Zutomayo held their first concert at the Daikanyama Loop in Tokyo. Attendees were handed opaque glasses and reported that the entire venue was dark for the duration of the concert. The group would continue to conceal their identities in future concerts as well.\n\nZutomayo released two more singles digitally before releasing their first EP, Tadashii Itsuwari Kara no Kishou, on November 14 in the same year, through record label EMI Records Japan. The EP peaked 8th on the Oricon Albums Chart and was nominated in the 19th CD Shop Awards. On June 5, 2019, a second EP was released titled Imawa Imade Chikaiwa Emide, which peaked at the number one spot on the Oricon chart. Later in that same year on October 30, they would release their first full-length album titled Hisohiso Banashi.\n\n__Members:__\n- [ACA-NE](https://anilist.co/staff/170316/ACANE) (ACAね, Akane) – vocalist, in-charge of lyrics and composition\n\n(Source: [Wikipedia (JP)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%9A%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8%E7%9C%9F%E5%A4%9C%E4%B8%AD%E3%81%A7%E3%81%84%E3%81%84%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AB%E3%80%82), edited)",
