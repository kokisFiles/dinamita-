Each story follows a different character’s encounter with one of those Killer Demons.\n<br><br>\nKiller Queen and Deep End was originally submitted for but did not win a Dengeki contest before Toaru Majutsu no Index was published. It was later published in 2004 in response to Index’s popularity. Killer Device and Never End was written and published in 2005 due to the popularity of the first story.\n",

However, his story caught the attention of the editor-in-chief of Dengeki, and Kamachi later became in-charge in writing the book Kaite-minai ka? (書いてみないか？? lit., Want to Try Writing?), which became his debut as a professional writer.\n\nKamachi began writing novels while he was still studying as a junior high school student. However, his works were not finished until he graduated from high school.",
