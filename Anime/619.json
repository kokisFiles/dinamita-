  "description": "On a dark, late night in New York City, Ryu is chased and attacked by assassins. After disposing of them, he finds an I.D. card for the Friedman Company. The next day, it is announced that Dr. Ned Friedman has discovered a cure for cancer. But after providing no information at his press conference, a reporter named Sarah decides to investigate with the help of her friends Robert and Jeff. When passing by Dr. Friedman's house one day, Ryu hears the voice of a young girl calling for help. When Sarah and her entourage investigate the house as well, they run into their colleague, Ryu. Upon that, they discover Dr. Friedman has been conducting experiments on live humans using biotechnology, and that it may have something to do with the power of the Evil Gods, whom Ryu had defeated in the past. But when Ryu's friend, Irene, is kidnapped, he must dawn his role as a Dragon Ninja once again to defeat this new enemy and save her.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "After graduating from Miyakojima Technical Senior High School, Kanbe moved to Tokyo and went to a Professional Training College while delivering newspapers to maintain himself. He joined Studio [Topcraft](https://anilist.co/studio/363/Topcraft) and as his first job he worked as production assistant on [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/).\n\nIn the late '80s and early '90s he worked on several NHK educational anime for children while he had his debut as director with the OVA [Ninja Ryuukenden](https://anilist.co/anime/619/Ninja-Ryuukenden/) in 1991. \n\nIn 1997 he established Studio Garan with several employees of [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/Studio-Junio) (which he had previously joined). Garan was one of the subcontracting studios for [Cardcaptor Sakura](https://anilist.co/anime/232/Cardcaptor-Sakura/) and the episodes Kanbe directed garnered much attention. He left Garan in 2000.\n\nMore recently he's been mainly known for directing psychological and thriller anime like [Elfen Lied](https://anilist.co/anime/226/Elfen-Lied/), [Electromagnetic Girlfriend](https://anilist.co/anime/5177/Electromagnetic-Girlfriend/) and [The Promised Neverland](https://anilist.co/anime/101759/The-Promised-Neverland/).",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/885163337809395712)\n\nAn irreplaceable member of the Japanese animation industry.\n\nInoue is an animator of the realist school whose skills are among the best in the world. He is known to often handle immense amounts of work in the titles he partakes in. Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",

[Hideyuki Morioka](https://anilist.co/staff/101526/) and [You Yoshinari](https://anilist.co/staff/102998/) were among his co-workers at the studio. In 1994, Oishi got involved on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/) as a key animator and during its production he met [Akiyuki Shinbou](https://anilist.co/staff/100089/), a prolific episode director on the series and a to be long-time colleague and friend of his. Oishi continued working as a freelance animator through the '90s.\n\nIn 2001, he made his directorial debut with the 46th episode of [Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier](https://anilist.co/anime/1678/). Soon after this he started getting involved in studio [Shaft](https://anilist.co/studio/44/)'s works with aforementioned Shinbou. In 2009, Shinbou and him directed [Bakemonogatari](https://anilist.co/anime/5081/) together, with Oishi serving as the chief director. In 2016, he directed the movie trilogy [Kizumonogatari](https://anilist.co/anime/9260/), which is considered to be his magnum-opus. Oishi usually draws his works' storyboards himself, and is known for taking a long time finishing them. Kizumonogatari's storyboards took him several years to complete.\n\n[Naoyuki Tatsuwa](https://anilist.co/staff/103584/), who has also been involved in many of Shaft's projects, called him the \"[Togashi](https://anilist.co/staff/96893/) of Shaft.\"",

          "description": "Tecmo Co., Ltd. (テクモ株式会社, Tekumo kabushikigaisha), was a Japanese video game corporation founded in 1967. It had its headquarters in Kudankita, Chiyoda, Tokyo. Its subsidiary, Tecmo Inc, was located in Torrance, California. Tecmo was formerly known as Tehkan.\n\nTecmo is known for the Captain Tsubasa, Dead or Alive, Deception, Fatal Frame, Gallop Racer, Monster Rancher, Ninja Gaiden, Rygar, Star Force and Tecmo Bowl video game series. When it was still called Tehkan, the company released arcade games such as Bomb Jack, Gridiron Fight and Tehkan World Cup. The company was founded on July 31, 1967 as a supplier of cleaning equipment. By 1969, it started to sell amusement equipment.\n\nIn 2009, Tecmo merged with Koei to form the holding company Tecmo Koei Holdings and was operated as a subsidiary until its disbandment in early 2010. In April 2010, Tecmo was dissolved and its video game franchises are now published by Koei Tecmo Games. Tecmo is also the name of a distinct video game development company that was established in March 2010, but later folded into Koei Tecmo Games in April 2011.",
