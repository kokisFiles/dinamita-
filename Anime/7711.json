  "description": "Arrietty, a tiny but tenacious 14-year-old, lives with her parents in the recesses of a suburban garden home, unbeknownst to the homeowner and her housekeeper. Like all little people, Arrietty remains hidden from view, except during occasional covert ventures beyond the floorboards to \"borrow\" scrap supplies like sugar cubes from her human hosts. But when 12-year-old Shou, a human boy who comes to stay in the home, discovers his mysterious housemate one evening, a secret friendship blossoms. If discovered, their relationship could drive Arrietty's family from the home and straight into danger.<br><br>\n(Source: Disney)",

          "description": "__Residency:__ Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan\n__Graduated:__ Gakushuin University (Department of Economics)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, script/screenwriter, author, mangaka and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He is the second of four brothers, and was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyou Ward. He is best known for his international fame as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of astonishing animated feature films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\n\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014, as well as having won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature, the only instances in which a non-English-language film has won the award. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n__Biography:__\nMiyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, which led to him eventually joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation) in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with the director [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/Isao-Takahata). Some notable films Miyazaki contributed to at Toei include [Doggie March](https://anilist.co/anime/9228/Wan-Wan-Chuushingura/) and [Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/2833/Gullivers-Travels-Beyond-the-Moon/). He provided key animation in other films at Toei, such as the Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to animation studio A-Pro in 1971, where he would co-direct the movie Lupin the Third Part I alongside Isao Takahata.

The films they made were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. His film [Princess Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/Princess-Mononoke/) was the first animated film to ever win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and it briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997, and its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Studio Ghibli's popularity and influence outside of Japan. His 2001 film [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/Spirited-Away/) became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films, [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/) (2004), [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/Ponyo/) (2008), and [The Wind Rises](https://anilist.co/anime/16662/The-Wind-Rises/) (2013) also enjoyed critical and commercial success.\n\nFollowing the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned again in 2016 to work on a new feature film, [The Boy and The Heron](https://anilist.co/anime/109979/The-Boy-and-the-Heron/) (2023). The film received critical acclaim, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and the second non-English-language film, after Spirited Away, to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards.

          "description": "__Residency:__ Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan\n__Graduated:__ Gakushuin University (Department of Economics)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, script/screenwriter, author, mangaka and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He is the second of four brothers, and was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyou Ward. He is best known for his international fame as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of astonishing animated feature films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\n\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014, as well as having won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature, the only instances in which a non-English-language film has won the award. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n__Biography:__\nMiyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, which led to him eventually joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation) in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with the director [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/Isao-Takahata). Some notable films Miyazaki contributed to at Toei include [Doggie March](https://anilist.co/anime/9228/Wan-Wan-Chuushingura/) and [Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/2833/Gullivers-Travels-Beyond-the-Moon/).

Suzuki is renowned as one of Japan's most successful producers after the enormous national box office success of many Ghibli films.\n\nHe was instrumental in getting the [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/) anime made and helped establish Studio Ghibli shortly after the film's release. Miyazaki has stated, \"If it were not for Mr. Suzuki, there wouldn't have been Studio Ghibli.\" Ghibli co-founder [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), has acknowledged the pivotal role of Suzuki in bringing the Nausicaä manga series into the world and used nearly identical words as Miyazaki to acknowledge Suzuki’s essential role in the creation of Studio Ghibli. Takahata also credits Suzuki for his steadfast support of Miyazaki and has cited Suzuki’s responsibility for making his friendship with Miyazaki endure.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

After Bevore's dissolution, he joined Atelier Giga, and from there he joined Project Team Muu. There he was jointly in charge of the character designs, animation direction and storyboards for [Giant Robo the Animation: The Day the Earth Stood Still](https://anilist.co/anime/2321/). The production took nearly 10 years, during which Yamashita gave it his all. After the production was over he started losing his motivation for animation. Though, it sparked again, after having met [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on the opening animation for a video game called, Gensou Suikogaiden. \n\nIn 2001, Yamashita worked as a key animator on [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/), a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) feature film. There he was in charge of multiple scenes, most notably Chihiro and Haru's free fall at the end of the movie. This earned him high high praise from [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), and he was thus selected as one of the animation director's for [How's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/). Since then he has served as an animation director on most of Ghibli's movies.\n\nIn 2018, Yamashita directed \"The Invisible Man,\" a short film part of the anthology collection [Modest Heroes](https://anilist.co/anime/103887/), produced by [Studio Ponoc](https://anilist.co/studio/6147/).

Ootsuka's animation is professional but always full of personality and a special verve. \n\nHe is one of the pillars of [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/)'s animation. Not confined to the Ghibli style, he has always searched for new means of expression, having done everything from the photorealistic to the cartoonish. The wonderful feeling of weight in the movement of Toshio running around the train station in [Only Yesterday](https://anilist.co/anime/1029/), the delightful bodyguards in [The Cat Returns](https://anilist.co/anime/597/), the little robot coming out of the water in the final episode of [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/) - all of these are quintessential Ootsuka. \n\nNone other than the animation director of [Tokyo Godfathers](https://anilist.co/anime/759/) has conceded that the film was originally conceived as a project to showcase Ootsuka's talents, in the same way [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/) was a vehicle for [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/). Most of Ootsuka's scenes in the film were drawn entirely by himself, with no in-betweens, and his cuts which were the first finished, had a determining influence on the direction of the animation by the rest of the animators. \n\n(Source: [Pelleas](http://www.pelleas.net/animators/#20))",

          "description": "Hamasu's animation mainly focuses on character acting, and his scenes often feature minimal camerawork with a heavy emphasis on expressive facial and body animation. Much like [Kouichi Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/121208/), he was heavily influenced by [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/) and the late '80s realism. Early in his career he was employed at Toei Animation, and was thus a recurring presence in the studio's OVA works such as [Xanadu](https://anilist.co/anime/5920/), [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/anime/1153/) and [Vampire Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/1765/). His rising prominence during the early '90s allowed him to participate on [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), and from thereon he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\nIn 1993, Hamasu animated the car chase on [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)’s episode of the [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/). The scene impressed Kon enough for Hamasu to end up as a character designer and animation director on [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/). He was also set to serve a similar role in [Millennium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), but was replaced in the role by [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/) due to having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. He appeared on all of Kon’s films, as well as [Paranoia Agent](https://anilist.co/anime/323/) until the director's passing.\n\nMore recently he has mostly worked on [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) and [Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/)'s films.",

She has since then been one of the lead animators in almost every single Ghibli film.\n\nFor her first job she drew the scene of Nausicaä listening to Yupa in Jiru's room, and also Nausicaä trying to save the old men in barge, and Nausicaä pushing the gunship to its limit near the end. In [Kiki](https://anilist.co/anime/512/) she drew over 50 shots of Kiki and Ursula at the log house. In [Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/) she drew the scene where the wolf is rescued from under the boars. In [Whisper of the Heart](https://anilist.co/anime/585/) she drew the scene that takes place in the rain. In [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/), she wanted to participate more as an animator, but was told to help out animation director [Masashi Andou](https://anilist.co/staff/106978/) after only having drawn a little animation, namely the scene at the beginning where Sen walks out of the tunnel. In [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/) she was able to come back full force as an animator. In films since then she has occasionally taken part as an animation director, but mostly as an animator.\n\n(Source: [Pelleas](http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/title_34))",
