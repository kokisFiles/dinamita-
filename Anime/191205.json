  "description": "At the age of two, Van, the fourth son of a marquis, recovered the memories of a previous life. He was becoming a child prodigy, but at the age of 8, he was found to have \"production magic\". In a world where offensive magic was considered superior, it was a \"useless\" aptitude.<br><br>\nHis disappointed father thought that Van was not fit to be a nobleman, and Van was banished to become the lord of a nameless remote village with only his personal maid, Till.\nIt was a desolate village with a population of only a hundred people and no local specialties, and it was on the verge of extinction.\nVan, seeing the situation, decided live a quiet life and develop the village with his knowledge from his previous life and his production magic, even though it was considered \"useless.\"\nHe not only equipped adventurers and built houses, but he also built a huge castle and even deployed ballistas for defense! The nameless frontier village was soon transformed into a huge city! A fantasy adventure of an exiled young reincarnated nobleman running a carefree domain is about to begin!\n<br><br>\n(Source: Bookwalker, translated)",
