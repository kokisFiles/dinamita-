The mangaka [Shinohara Kenta](https://anilist.co/staff/97994/Shinohara-Kenta) is his brother-in-law.\n\nYabuki is best known for his series Black Cat, which ran from 2000 to 2004 in Weekly Shounen Jump and later adapted into an anime. Upon its ending, Yabuki expressed desire to make a sequel from the series, or make its characters reappear in another work. From 2004 to 2020, he only worked as illustrator to works written by other authors, most notably on To Love-Ru alongside his former assistant Saki Hasemi. That was until the release of Ayakashi Triangle on the pages of Shounen Jump in 2020.",
