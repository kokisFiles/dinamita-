In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/).

Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",

He is known to often handle immense amounts of work in the titles he partakes in. Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",

He started quickly making a name for himself as a background artist and consequently established his own background art studio Kobayashi Production, in 1968. During this time thick poster paint was dominating the backgrounds in anime, but Kobayashi started a new style with much thinner painting and colored pencil strokes.\n\nHe has worked as an art director on over 100 titles and is one of the most distinguished art directors in the medium.
