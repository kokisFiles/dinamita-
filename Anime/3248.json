The promise he showed in the program led him to be selected as assistant director to [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) in [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/).\n\nIn 2008, he made his full directorial debut with [Bounen no Xamdou](https://anilist.co/anime/4177/). In an interview to The Japan Times, Miyaji stated that he believed anime was a part of the film industry, and said in respect to Xamdou's \"theatrical dimension,\" he had wished to use an \"almost documentary style\" for certain parts and listed directors Ken Loach and Jean-Luc Godard as his inspirations. He also felt he could reach a different kind of an audience with the series' unique Playstation Network release.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Also the leading producer of its Studio B.\n\nAfter graduating from Osaka University of Arts, Minami joined [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/) in 1984. There he did desk work and served as a production assistant on many of [Masuo Ueda](https://anilist.co/staff/148840/)'s productions. He was promoted to producer on [Musha Knight Commando](https://anilist.co/anime/9087/) in 1991, and from there he went on to produce shows such as [Mobile Fighter G Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/96/), [Vision of Escaflowne](https://anilist.co/anime/182/) and [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/). In 1998, he left Sunrise and established Bones with [Toshihiro Kawamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/103531/) and the late [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/). He was elected as the representative director of the studio and has held the position since.\n\nMinami's classmates at university included [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), [Hiroyuki Yamaga](https://anilist.co/staff/100988/), and [Kazuhiko Shimamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/97479/). He appears as a character in the manga [Aoi Honoo](https://anilist.co/manga/55292/), which Shimamoto wrote about his own university days. The manga also received a TV drama adaptation, in which Minami was portrayed by actor Kaname Endou.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
