While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition.

He initially failed an examination test for [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/) but was later scouted by the late [Osamu Kobayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/100406/) for [Beck](https://anilist.co/anime/57/). There he met noted animators [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/), the former which he would work with on numerous occasions afterwards.\n\nHis breakthrough as an animator was on [Noein](https://anilist.co/anime/584/), a series directed by [Kazuki Akane](https://anilist.co/staff/102416/). The 12th episode was highly regarded by animation fans and other animators for the given display by him and Matsumoto. He would later also serve as a character designer on [Birdy the Mighty: Decode](https://anilist.co/anime/3974/), another series directed by Akane.\n\nHis dedication for animation could also be seen on [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/), for which he animated a minute-long scene of the main character running down a street. He went on the actual street in Tokyo to film himself for reference footage for the cut.",
