  "description": "Mitsuru is beautiful, graceful and admired by many people, but she has a weird problem--a single, violent movement against her can get her begging sweetly for more! Her nickname M, also stands for masochistic. Natsuhiko, is a guy who found out Mitsuru's secret on their first day of senior high school. Even so, he has an equally bad problem--the mere glimpse of his reflection can send him into a flying fit about how beautiful he is! He is nicknamed as N for narcissistic. They both hope to minimize their chances of being exposed because of their weird behaviours. \n<br><br>\n<b>Included one-shots:</b><br>\nVolume 1: Torikago Shoujo<br>\nVolume 2: Ouka Kaidan<br>\nVolume 5: Setsunai Koi no Monogatari",

          "description": "[Website](http://higunet.boo.jp/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kobutar) | [Facebook](http://facebook.com/higuniwa)\n\nWith an interview with Tokyopop she gave a detailed look on how she started as a mangaka.\n\n\"I first submitted a manga story a while after I graduated from high school. Up until then I was studying for the entrance examinations for the Art University, and as part of that, I sometimes drew manga and four-panel strip comics for fun.\n\nBecause I was conscious of the fact that I had started drawing manga in earnest at a later age, I think my progress during the beginning on drawing and storytelling techniques was fast as I frantically tried to absorb everything I could learn about creating manga. After the serialization of the story began, as I got busy, I was so desperate to submit it on time that I feel that the drawings probably haven’t improved much compared to before. During the serialization of the manga, I think my story telling techniques improved more as I concerned myself with how to catch the attention of the readers, how well one can incorporate what the readers are seeking into the story.\"",
