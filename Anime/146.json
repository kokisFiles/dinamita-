  "description": "High school student Takeru Takemoto works part time as a (motor)bike courier. During one of his deliveries, he saw a mysterious light passing him and fell into a forest. What he had found was a beautiful girl coming out from a glowing cocoon, calling herself \"Hikari.\" While Takeru was quite embarrassed because of Hikari's nudity, a strange monster suddenly showed up and immediately attacked the two. Both Takeru and Hikari demonstrated the power of their other selves before Takeru had a clue of what's going on.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "Akira Amemiya is an animator and up-and-coming director best known for directing [SSSS.GRIDMAN](https://anilist.co/anime/99424/SSSSGRIDMAN) and being Studio Trigger founder [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/Hiroyuki-Imaishi)'s protege. Amemiya's [animation and directing](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mini-imaishi.mp4) is very similar to Imaishi's yet is less chaotic and contains more 'retro' devices like impact frames and multi-tonal shading, drawing a lot of inspiration from [Masami Obari](https://anilist.co/staff/100660/Masami-Obari). For these reasons he was frequently typecasted for old school pose-heavy mecha combat.\n\nAmemiya is a nerdy director whose anime often heavily references other series and artists he loves, sometimes even replicating Obari's [animation sequences](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dangaioh2.mp4) and [layouts](https://i.imgur.com/nTRdM4K.jpg), [Transformer](https://twitter.com/SSS_SGRID/status/1051063114022572033)'s color designs, and Hideaki Anno's [establishing shots](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/welcome-to-the-anno-class.jpg) as well as long-lingering framing. Amemiya called Anno's [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/) his [favorite series before](https://i.imgur.com/nEYK186.png). Between his ode-heavy artistry he interjects personality with [subtle details](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/what-kind-of-brand-is-TOMATO-LIFE-tho.jpg), visual gags, and repurposing tonally contrasting homages into a different context.\n\nAmemiya graduated from Tokyo University of Technology and was part of the university's anime research society. During his time there he became heavily influenced by Osaka University's anime research club [Group CAS](https://twitter.com/group_cas). At the time [Toshiyuki Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/107357/Toshiyuki-Satou) was part of the group, while [Ikehata Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/120505/Ikehata-Hiroshi) visited regularly. After a bit of indie work Amemiya joined studio Gainax and climbed up the hierarchy: from clean-up to animation direction, onto storyboarding and episode directing, until after joining studio Trigger and co-directing Kill la Kill finally having the credentials to debut with his own series.\n\nHe is married to animator [Megumi Kouno](https://anilist.co/staff/120602/Megumi-Kouno).\n\n",

Yoshinari entered the anime industry through the influence of his older brother, [Kou Yoshinari](https://anilist.co/staff/102136/). Several of his early works were uncredited second key animation and in-betweens for his brother during high school. After leaving professional school, he applied to [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/) and [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/). Not receiving a response from Gainax, he joined Madhouse. Due to a misunderstanding, Gainax failed to process his application until three months later. Not wanting to explain, Yoshinari told Madhouse; \"being an animator is too hard for me,\" and switched to Gainax.\n\nAt Gainax, Yoshinari had joined just after the closure of [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). With nothing to do, he was immediately put onto visual development for the film [Aoki Uru](https://anilist.co/anime/21430/), although the film’s production was later broken off due to the studio’s financial state. Undoubtedly his breakout as an animator was just a few years later when he served as one of the lead animators in [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/). Yoshinari worked at Gainax until leaving for Trigger in 2011, a studio founded by fellow ex-Gainax members, [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/) and [Masahiko Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/). At Trigger he debuted as a director on [Little Witch Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/14349/).\n\nYoshinari is recognized by the way he represents volume and perspective using spheres, especially for smoke and explosions, as well as his character action in general. His characters often borrow traits from western animation, such as rectangular heads, low contrast shading, big eyes and angular lineart. He uses expertly timed smears, dramatic camerawork, and complicated background animation to convey dynamism. His movement is springy and tense, cleanly situated in the dominant cartoony style of ‘00s Gainax. He remarks [Nijitte Monogatari](https://anilist.co/manga/112385/) as one of his most important influences, with his artistic style particularly visible in his design work for [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/) and Little Witch Academia.\n\nAlso a big fan of [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/)’s, having done multiple short [animations](https://anilist.co/anime/123638/) based on his manga characters.\n\nMarried to producer [Naoko Tsutsumi](https://anilist.co/staff/150017/).\n\n(Sources: Wikipedia, Anidb, Animators Wiki)",
