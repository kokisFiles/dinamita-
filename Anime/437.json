  "description": "Rising pop star Mima has quit singing to pursue a career as an actress and model, but her fans aren’t ready to see her go... Encouraged by her managers, Mima takes on a recurring role on a popular TV show, when suddenly her handlers and collaborators begin turning up murdered. Harboring feelings of guilt and haunted by visions of her former self, Mima’s reality and fantasy meld into a frenzied paranoia. As her stalker closes in, in person and online, the threat he poses is more real than even Mima knows, in this iconic psychological thriller that has frequently been hailed as one of the most important animated films of all time.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Shout! Factory)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: The film received an early premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival on August 5, 1997.</i>",

He made his initial splash in [Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket](https://anilist.co/anime/82/), and continued to develop his approach to animation which he calls \"full limited,\" which eliminated the pose-to-pose feel of conventional keyframe animation. His characteristic animation can be seen in [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) and [End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/).\n\nIn [Blood: The Last Vampire](https://anilist.co/anime/405/), Iso experimented with digital processing of his hand-drawn fire effects, elevating it to uncanny realism. Iso then got his first taste of directing in [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/) episode 15, which he largely animated and also digitally processed himself.\n\nHis animation sensibilities, process innovations, experience in multiple levels of anime production, and interest in technology culminated in the 2007 sci-fi series, [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/), his veritable brainchild. During its production, there was a rumored falling-out with key staff. For the next several years, Iso would quietly animate under the pseudonym Mikio Odagawa.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2018, he announced his retirement as an animator to focus exclusively on directing.",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/本田雄)\n\nAfter dropping out from Tokyo Designers' College in 1987, Honda joined Atelier Giga. He later joined [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/), where he debuted as the studio's youngest animation director on [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). A few years later in 1994, he got to handle the character designs for the first time on [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/), a TV series directed by [Akiyuki Shinbou](https://anilist.co/staff/100089/).\n\nAfter having left Gainax, Honda participated in most of [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)'s works. Perhaps most notably as a character designer on [Millenium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), a role which was originally planned to be [Hideki Hamasu](https://anilist.co/staff/125820/)'s, but was given to him due to Hamasu having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. Honda also designed the characters for [Mitsuo Iso](https://anilist.co/staff/100151/)'s [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/).\n\nIn 2006, Honda joined [Studio Khara](https://anilist.co/studio/47/) and reprised his vital staff roles in the [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/2759/) franchise. The same year he made his long-awaited debut in a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) film, working as a key animator on [Tales from Earthsea](https://anilist.co/anime/1829/) and then again on [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/). His work received high praise by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) for expressing the characters' individuality through their movements.\n\nNicknamed as \"Master\" (師匠, Shishou), by [Takahiro Kishida](https://anilist.co/staff/101403/) during the production of [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/). Since then the nickname has been widely recognized within the industry.",

Much like [Kouichi Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/121208/), he was heavily influenced by [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/) and the late '80s realism. Early in his career he was employed at Toei Animation, and was thus a recurring presence in the studio's OVA works such as [Xanadu](https://anilist.co/anime/5920/), [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/anime/1153/) and [Vampire Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/1765/). His rising prominence during the early '90s allowed him to participate on [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), and from thereon he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\nIn 1993, Hamasu animated the car chase on [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)’s episode of the [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/). The scene impressed Kon enough for Hamasu to end up as a character designer and animation director on [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/). He was also set to serve a similar role in [Millennium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), but was replaced in the role by [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/) due to having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. He appeared on all of Kon’s films, as well as [Paranoia Agent](https://anilist.co/anime/323/) until the director's passing.\n\nMore recently he has mostly worked on [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) and [Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/)'s films.",
