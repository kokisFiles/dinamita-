  "description": "January 2118. Chief Inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department, Akane Tsunemori, receives a report of an incident on a foreign vessel – the body of Professor Milicia Stronskaya has been discovered. Behind the incident is a group known as the Peacebreakers, a foreign paramilitary organization and a new outside threat who are targeting the professor's research documents known as the “Stronskaya Papers.” Reunited with Shinya Kogami, a former fugitive from the Criminal Investigation Department, Akane grapples with a case that quickly escalates beyond their expectations. The Stronskaya Papers could reveal a truth that would shake Japan's government, and even the Sibyl System, to the core. It is in this untold story that the missing link is revealed. \n<br><br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

After graduating he joined [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/) becoming one of their most promising young animators. \n\nAfter some years spent climbing to the position of animation director on series such as [Windy Tales](https://anilist.co/anime/1524/Windy-Tales/), he left his first creative mark on the industry by directing, storyboarding and supervising [Blood+](https://anilist.co/anime/150/)'s kaleidoscopic 3rd Opening. \n\nHe had his directorial debut with [Tokyo Marble Chocolate](https://anilist.co/anime/3088/), OVA produced as a collaboration between Production I.G. and BMG Japan in commemoration of both companies' 20th anniversaries. The OVA was awarded the Grand Prize in the Feature Film Category of the 12th Seoul International Cartoon & Animation Festival in 2008.\n\nShiotani is most famous for being the director of the [Psycho-Pass](https://anilist.co/anime/13601/) series. Initially planned with a post-apocalyptic setting, the concept changed after the Great East Japan Earthquake and evolved into its final form. The series is inspired by detective crime stories and sci-fi (Minority Report, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Patlabor) with the precise intent of exploring societal problems. \n\n",

They were born in 1973, but the month and day are unknown.  Amano began in 1998 with a job at Weekly Young Magazine. They also held a job at Shueisha Publishing Co, Ltd.  In 2002, Amano participated in a contest for aspiring mangaka and was one of the lucky winners, with their comic Monkey Business published in Young Magazine.  In 2004, they finally found success with the humorous and classy manga Katekyo Hitman Reborn! (or, for short, just Reborn!), and that thanks to their readers' support. This new manga was advertised more and more in Shonen Jump and became a hit. Two years later, their manga was made into an anime series by Artland studios. \n\nTheir ideas for Reborn!: Amano had some crazy ideas to entertain readers with. They came up with weird characters to add spice to the humor, a story written especially to be unique, and fast-paced action.    \n\nOther works:  Boy Spin (1998)  Hot Blast Baseball Legendary (1999)  Pu Chipu Chirabii (2000)  Monkey Business (2002)  Tapir Hearts HAWK!
