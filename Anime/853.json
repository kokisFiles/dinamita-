  "description": "Fujioka Haruhi wins a scholarship to attend Ouran Academy, a school reserved for only the most rich and prestigious. Despite what other students may think of her, she cares little for physical appearances or the fact that she is a commoner.<br><br>\nUnfortunately for Haruhi, her high school days take a sudden turn when she stumbles upon the Host Club, an elite club filled with super rich and beautiful boys who use their specific traits and charms to entertain young ladies. Even worse, Haruhi accidentally breaks an 8-million yen vase in the club. Since she is unable to repay her debt with money, Haruhi finds herself with no choice but to work for the Host Club, becoming a male host herself.",

          "description": "Victor Joseph Mignogna was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. He was always interested in drama, film, music,acting, and majored in Film in college. Vic spent approximately ten years acting in independent films and composing, transposing and producing music for ad agencies, TV series, and movies. \n\nIn 1998, through a connection from a work associate at the time, Vic made his debut as Vega in \"Street Fighter 2\" under ADV Films. Vic enjoyed the anime dubbing experience and continued working for ADV. Soon, he landed his first main character role as Gawl in \"Generator Gawl\". Over time, Vic also began working for FUNimation Entertainment, and moved from Houston, Texas to Los Angeles, California to continue work there in late 2008. In February 2019, studios Funimation and Rooster Teeth cut ties with Mignogna after a number of sexual harassment allegations surfaced. Mignogna has denied the allegations and filed a lawsuit against Funimation and several individuals in April 2019 alleging defamation and tortious interference, however, the case was dismissed on October 2019 and he was ordered by the court to pay the defendants' legal fees. Mignogna lost his appeals from Funimation and their actors in 2022.\n\nSince then, his acting career has relatively stalled, though he remains active on social media and continues to attend fan conventions. He founded dubbing studio \"AM Studios\" in partnership with the Anime Matsuri convention. \n\n__Music:__\nVic has continued his music career, releasing five albums, Selah (original piano music), Metafiction (original music, including the anime-related songs Nothing I Won't Give [Fullmetal Alchemist]) and Soldier A, saluting the generic soldiers of anime), If These Walls Could Talk (original music), a Christmas album (including 2 original songs), and Selah II (the sequel to Selah, also original piano compositions). His sixth album, which is a remix album, remixing some of his original songs and some popular songs, is set to be released in February of 2010. This album also contains Vic's English version of the Brothers Theme from \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" and the English version of the \"D.N.Angel\" opening theme, True Light, both of which are licensed.\n\n__Roles:__\nVic has now appeared in approximately 150 anime series and video games, and has sung many English dub theme songs, most notably in the FUNimation dub of \"One Piece\".

He left NeoMedia in 1982 to work as a freelancer, starting with [Combat Mecha Xabungle](https://anilist.co/anime/2254/) and [Makyou Densetsu Acrobunch](https://anilist.co/anime/3880/).\n\nThe popular anime [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/), in which he participated from the same year, was Moriyama's breakthrough work. With this series, he made his debut as an animation director and storyboard artist, and was in charge of the opening animation for the first time, joining a group of popular animators overnight. Chief director [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/), who was responsible for Urusei Yatsura, expected him to become a partner, so Moriyama tried his hand at manga as well by illustrating a manga written by Oshii that was serialized in the Animage magazine in 1984 called Todo no Tsumari. After the end of Urusei Yatsura, he was selected as a character designer for the later series [Maison Ikkoku](https://anilist.co/anime/1453/), and has since been in charge of character design for many other works. In 1987, he won the 4th Japan Anime Awards in the Animation Director category. After that, he shifted from animating to directing.\nAfter that he participated in many works, mainly Chaos Project , Studio Pierrot , and Studio Hibari and then has seated at Studio Hibari's Lerche. \n\nMoriyama often works under one of his many pen-names.\n\n",

After switching several studios; from Art Office Sharaku, to Anime Torotoro, to [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), he eventually settled at [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/) with a contract.\n\nNakamura is considered to be among the best action animators, with his scenes featuring catchy movement and effects. Some of his recognizable traits include camera shaking, blurs, and bending and stretching high-speed objects. His fights are praised for its weighty, intense choreographies that are heavy on impact frames. His signature trait is drawing debris as simple cubes, consequentially named \"Yutapon Cubes,\" which are stylistic and easy to draw. Despite being responsible for popularizing it, Nakamura has stated that he started doing it when he noticed [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) doing it. \n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",

During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/).
