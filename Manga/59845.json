Samon is supposedly not as good at swordplay as his brother, but Iemitsu definitely prefers him as a companion. Will the obstacles in the path of Samon and Iemitsu's relationship prove impossible to overcome?<br><br>\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

At some point in the 1990s, he befriended Yoshiaki Tabata, and following their collaboration on the 1999 indie film *Battle Yaro* (conceptualized by Yogo), the two would go on to continue collaborating on numerous works throughout the years - most notably *Akumetsu*, *Wolf Guy*, *Shin Mazinger Zero*, and the 2013 manga adaptation of *Ninja Slayer* - with Yogo providing the art and Tabata writing the scripts.\n\nHis notable non-manga works include designing Hijikata Toshizou for the mobile game *Fate/Grand Order* and providing Bugnaraku Empire monster design for the tokusatsu show *Ohsama Sentai Kingohger*. He has also contributed art for Akita Shoten's 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami relief charity auction, as well as celebratory illustrations for Weekly Shonen Champion's 50th anniversary and the 30th anniversary of *Urayasu Tekkin Kazoku*.\n\nHe has a habit of using Ninjahead slang and catchphrases in his commentary and social media, regardless of whether he's commenting on something Ninja Slayer-related or not.",
