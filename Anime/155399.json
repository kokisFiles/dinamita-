This brought Maeda enough recognition to get invited on the production of [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), and the subseqeunt late '80s [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) films. He also worked on [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s projects during this time.\n\nIn 1992, after having completely cut ties with Ghibli due to differences in working methods, Maeda founded Gonzo together with [Shinji Higuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/107646/), [Hiroshi Yamaguchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97308/) and [Shouji Murahama](https://anilist.co/staff/119708/), who were Gainax employees he had previously worked with on [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/) and [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). At Gonzo he debuted as a director in 1998 with [Blue Submarine No.6](https://anilist.co/anime/1051/).\n\nIn 2004, Maeda directed [Gankutsuou](https://anilist.co/anime/239/), an adaptation of an 1844 novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, by [Alexandre Dumas](https://anilist.co/staff/102535/). Initially Maeda wanted to adapt an Alfred Bester novel, The Stars My Destination, but was rejected by the novel's copyright holders after proposing the numerous changes he wanted to make to the original narrative. He then searched for another work he could adapt into a science fiction setting and ended up going with The Count of Monte Cristo. The series was praised by Western critics and received multiple international accolades.\n\nCalled one of the most imaginative visualists in anime by Helen McCarthy, a British anime reference book author.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nKnown to have been a close friend of [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s before his passing.",

In 1984 he founded Studio Gainax along with [Takami Akai](https://anilist.co/staff/102032/Takami-Akai) and [Hiroyuki Yamaga](https://anilist.co/staff/100988/Hiroyuki-Yamaga). As Anno grew up with anime and 8mm experimental film, he brought a mindset of homage and intertextuality novel to anime at the time.

Gunbuster!](https://anilist.co/anime/949/Gunbuster/), as the 6-episode space opera built up a reputation, in particular for its high-stakes monochrome finale. He would follow this up with being chief director for [Fushigi no Umi no Nadia](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/Fushigi-no-Umi-no-Nadia/), but was absent for an infamous stretch of episodes called the Island arc, where Shinji Higuchi was asked to take over. Due to Nadia's rampant success, the television broadcaster requested another cour of episodes. Anno was working on the series for 18 hours a day at this point.\n\nAnno suffered from depression and became dispirited about anime production after not being permitted the creative freedom he wanted with *Nadia*, which fueled inspiration for one of the most important and popular works of the medium: [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/). It remains a highly unique take on the mecha genre, casting the lead as indecisive and ineffectual instead of the typical enthusiastic, hotheaded hero. The show became infamous for its plot-driven episodes of the first half giving way to increasingly abstract character studies and deconstructions in the second. This reached its pinnacle in the finale episodes which were, due to a mixture of financial issues and Anno skirting the deadline, so experimental that they received significant negative reception. In response, Anno directed a feature-length sequel called [The End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/End-of-Evangelion/) that, though sporting higher production values, was no less experimental and surrealist than the series proper.\n\nEvangelion's massive financial success helped spurn more interest in late night anime, causing a boom in the market. Up to this day it remains a highly influential show, with many visual and narrative references to be found in contemporary anime. \n\nAfter Evangelion, Anno handled the adaptation of shoujo romance [Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/). Despite its more straightforward narrative, its aesthetic was highly distinctive in its use of stills and cropped framings to emulate the experience of reading a shoujo manga, with Anno even filming pages of the manga in a few extreme cases. \n\nIn 2007 Anno decided to leave studio Gainax after several years of poor production and financial mismanagement, and established studio Khara, and began working on the Rebuild of Evangelion film series, which are lavishly animated reboots/continuations of the TV series.\n\n__Non-anime credits:__\n- Writer and director for ''Love & Pop''\n- Writer and director for ''Ritual''\n- Writer and director for ''Ryusei-kacho''\n- Writer and director for ''Cutie Honey (live-action movie)''\n- Writer and director for ''Shin Godzilla''\n- Writer for ''Shin Ultraman''\n- Writer and director for ''Shin Kamen Rider''",

He was inspired to enter the field because he liked [Hidenori Matsubara](https://anilist.co/staff/107672/) and [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/)'s drawings.\n\nHis first major role was serving as character animation director for [Top wo Nerae 2!

This experience led him to become one of the main character designers at the studio, designing the iconic characters for [Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/).\n\nHe left Gainax to have his debut as director on [The Idolm@ster](https://anilist.co/anime/10278/The-Idol-Master/), a personal passion project since he's a great fan of the series. Several Gainax staff followed Nishigori to [A-1 Pictures](https://anilist.co/studio/561/) and worked on the series, alongside staff from newly formed [Trigger](https://anilist.co/studio/803/Trigger).\n\nIn 2018 he directed his original project [Darling in the Franxx](https://anilist.co/anime/99423/), once again reuniting with his Gainax friends spread among [CloverWorks](https://anilist.co/studio/6222/), Trigger and [Studio Khara](https://anilist.co/studio/47/).\n\nMore recently he worked as character designer and chief animation director for [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/)'s final Evangelion installment, [Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon A Time](https://anilist.co/anime/3786/Evangelion-3010-Thrice-Upon-A-Time/).",

This brought Maeda enough recognition to get invited on the production of [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), and the subseqeunt late '80s [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) films. He also worked on [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s projects during this time.\n\nIn 1992, after having completely cut ties with Ghibli due to differences in working methods, Maeda founded Gonzo together with [Shinji Higuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/107646/), [Hiroshi Yamaguchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97308/) and [Shouji Murahama](https://anilist.co/staff/119708/), who were Gainax employees he had previously worked with on [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/) and [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). At Gonzo he debuted as a director in 1998 with [Blue Submarine No.6](https://anilist.co/anime/1051/).\n\nIn 2004, Maeda directed [Gankutsuou](https://anilist.co/anime/239/), an adaptation of an 1844 novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, by [Alexandre Dumas](https://anilist.co/staff/102535/). Initially Maeda wanted to adapt an Alfred Bester novel, The Stars My Destination, but was rejected by the novel's copyright holders after proposing the numerous changes he wanted to make to the original narrative. He then searched for another work he could adapt into a science fiction setting and ended up going with The Count of Monte Cristo. The series was praised by Western critics and received multiple international accolades.\n\nCalled one of the most imaginative visualists in anime by Helen McCarthy, a British anime reference book author.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nKnown to have been a close friend of [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s before his passing.",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/前田真宏_(アニメ監督%29)\n\nA prominent anime creator and one of the founders of studio [Gonzo](https://anilist.co/studio/3/).\n\nWhile still in university, Maeda was part of a manga club together with [Yoshiyuki Sadamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/98158/), during which both of them got invited to participate on [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) and [Daicon IV](https://anilist.co/anime/121664/). This brought Maeda enough recognition to get invited on the production of [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), and the subseqeunt late '80s [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) films. He also worked on [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s projects during this time.\n\nIn 1992, after having completely cut ties with Ghibli due to differences in working methods, Maeda founded Gonzo together with [Shinji Higuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/107646/), [Hiroshi Yamaguchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97308/) and [Shouji Murahama](https://anilist.co/staff/119708/), who were Gainax employees he had previously worked with on [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/) and [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). At Gonzo he debuted as a director in 1998 with [Blue Submarine No.6](https://anilist.co/anime/1051/).\n\nIn 2004, Maeda directed [Gankutsuou](https://anilist.co/anime/239/), an adaptation of an 1844 novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, by [Alexandre Dumas](https://anilist.co/staff/102535/). Initially Maeda wanted to adapt an Alfred Bester novel, The Stars My Destination, but was rejected by the novel's copyright holders after proposing the numerous changes he wanted to make to the original narrative. He then searched for another work he could adapt into a science fiction setting and ended up going with The Count of Monte Cristo. The series was praised by Western critics and received multiple international accolades.\n\nCalled one of the most imaginative visualists in anime by Helen McCarthy, a British anime reference book author.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nKnown to have been a close friend of [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s before his passing.",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/本田雄)\n\nAfter dropping out from Tokyo Designers' College in 1987, Honda joined Atelier Giga. He later joined [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/), where he debuted as the studio's youngest animation director on [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). A few years later in 1994, he got to handle the character designs for the first time on [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/), a TV series directed by [Akiyuki Shinbou](https://anilist.co/staff/100089/).\n\nAfter having left Gainax, Honda participated in most of [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)'s works. Perhaps most notably as a character designer on [Millenium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), a role which was originally planned to be [Hideki Hamasu](https://anilist.co/staff/125820/)'s, but was given to him due to Hamasu having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. Honda also designed the characters for [Mitsuo Iso](https://anilist.co/staff/100151/)'s [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/).\n\nIn 2006, Honda joined [Studio Khara](https://anilist.co/studio/47/) and reprised his vital staff roles in the [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/2759/) franchise. The same year he made his long-awaited debut in a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) film, working as a key animator on [Tales from Earthsea](https://anilist.co/anime/1829/) and then again on [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/). His work received high praise by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) for expressing the characters' individuality through their movements.\n\nNicknamed as \"Master\" (師匠, Shishou), by [Takahiro Kishida](https://anilist.co/staff/101403/) during the production of [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/). Since then the nickname has been widely recognized within the industry.",

He was inspired to enter the field because he liked [Hidenori Matsubara](https://anilist.co/staff/107672/) and [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/)'s drawings.\n\nHis first major role was serving as character animation director for [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/Gunbuster-2-Diebuster/), with the task of adapting [Yoshiyuki Sadamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/98158/Yoshiyuki-Sadamoto)'s character designs for animation. This experience led him to become one of the main character designers at the studio, designing the iconic characters for [Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/).\n\nHe left Gainax to have his debut as director on [The Idolm@ster](https://anilist.co/anime/10278/The-Idol-Master/), a personal passion project since he's a great fan of the series. Several Gainax staff followed Nishigori to [A-1 Pictures](https://anilist.co/studio/561/) and worked on the series, alongside staff from newly formed [Trigger](https://anilist.co/studio/803/Trigger).\n\nIn 2018 he directed his original project [Darling in the Franxx](https://anilist.co/anime/99423/), once again reuniting with his Gainax friends spread among [CloverWorks](https://anilist.co/studio/6222/), Trigger and [Studio Khara](https://anilist.co/studio/47/).\n\nMore recently he worked as character designer and chief animation director for [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/)'s final Evangelion installment, [Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon A Time](https://anilist.co/anime/3786/Evangelion-3010-Thrice-Upon-A-Time/).",
