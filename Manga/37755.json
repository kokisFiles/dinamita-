  "description": "Welcome to the vampire city of Saruta, where the sun never rises, and all the vampire children love trying to stay up late. Hipira is a precocious young vampire whose best friend is a fairy named Soul. Hipira and Soul are an odd couple to say the least, and their games, pranks and adventures are extraordinary even for dwellers of this supernatural city. Hipira is a delightfully bright twist to traditionally dark subject matter. Filled with fun, wonder and heart, the illustrations look like they have been pulled off the screen of a top-flight animated feature. Hipira is a children's book like no other, one that will appeal to readers of all ages. (Amazon)",

After having graduated high school in 1973, he left Miyagi, heading to Tokyo with the hopes of becoming a mangaka. He made his debut later on the same year with a manga adaptation of Prosper Mérimée's short novel Mateo Falcone, titled A Gun Report. In 1979, after writing multiple short-stories for the magazine Action, Ootomo created his first science-fiction work, titled Fireball. Although the manga was never completed, it is regarded as a milestone in Ootomo's career, containing many of the same themes he would later explore in [Doumu](https://anilist.co/manga/31215/), which began serialization in January 1980 and ran for two years until completed.\n\nIn 1982, Ootomo made his anime debut as character designer on [Harmagedon](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/). After this Ootomo began working on Akira, which would become his most acclaimed and famous work. The manga took eight years to complete and would eventually culminate in 2000 pages of artwork.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
