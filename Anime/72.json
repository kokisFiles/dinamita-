But when Kaname gets into some serious trouble, Sousuke takes the guise of Bonta-kun - the gun-wielding, butt-kicking mascot. And while he struggles to continue living as a normal teenager, Sousuke also has to deal with protecting his superior officer Teletha Testarossa, who has decided to take a vacation from Mithril and spend a couple of weeks as his and Kaname's classmate.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

In 1991, he made his debut as a director with [Shiawasette Naani](https://anilist.co/anime/13441/). After that, he switched his focus to directing. Back then Kyoto Animation was still a sub-contracting studio, so therefore Ishihara could only get a handful of opportunities directing. Some of the shows in which Ishihara got to direct multiple episodes were [Tenchi Muyou!](https://anilist.co/anime/696/), [Aka-chan to Boku](https://anilist.co/anime/1485/), [Hyper Police](https://anilist.co/anime/1180/), and [Inuyasha](https://anilist.co/anime/249/). He also storyboarded the majority of the episodes he directed.\n\nIn 2003, Kyoto Animation started their transformation into a full-fledged animation studio producing their first anime series, [Fullmetal Panic? Fumoffu](https://anilist.co/anime/72/). Ishihara directed and storyboarded the 7th episode of the show. Two years later in 2005, he made his proper directorial debut directing the studio's second TV show, [Air](https://anilist.co/anime/101/). The following year he directed the award winning anime series, [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://anilist.co/anime/849/). From here Ishihara has gone on to direct multiple of Kyoto Animation's acclaimed works.",

Infamous for his incendiary behavior on Twitter and for having been fired from [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) and [Ordet](https://anilist.co/studio/334/), the latter of which he helped co-found. \n\nAs a member of Kyoto Animation, he rose to prominence within the company after serving as assistant director on [Munto 2: Beyond the Walls of Time](https://anilist.co/anime/1135/). In 2006, he was selected to be the chief episode director of [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://anilist.co/anime/849/), after which he became well known among anime fans for the ending dance theme he choreographed. He was to make his full directorial debut with [Lucky Star](https://anilist.co/anime/1887/), but was replaced after four episodes due to \"performance issues.\" In a later radio interview, Yamamoto confirmed he was fired by Kyoto Animation and unsuccessfully attempted to win back his job. \n\nYamamoto has threatened to quit his career in anime production six times over the years. In May 2019, Yamamoto vowed never to \"work on anything related to animation again\" after finishing [Hakubo](https://anilist.co/anime/98784/). He has become notorious for his incendiary behavior on Twitter, including calling fans of anime \"mentally disabled,\" discriminatory remarks about Chinese and Korean anime fans, and attacking his former cast members, which resulted in him being temporarily suspended from Twitter in 2018.",

Infamous for his incendiary behavior on Twitter and for having been fired from [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) and [Ordet](https://anilist.co/studio/334/), the latter of which he helped co-found. \n\nAs a member of Kyoto Animation, he rose to prominence within the company after serving as assistant director on [Munto 2: Beyond the Walls of Time](https://anilist.co/anime/1135/). In 2006, he was selected to be the chief episode director of [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://anilist.co/anime/849/), after which he became well known among anime fans for the ending dance theme he choreographed. He was to make his full directorial debut with [Lucky Star](https://anilist.co/anime/1887/), but was replaced after four episodes due to \"performance issues.\" In a later radio interview, Yamamoto confirmed he was fired by Kyoto Animation and unsuccessfully attempted to win back his job. \n\nYamamoto has threatened to quit his career in anime production six times over the years. In May 2019, Yamamoto vowed never to \"work on anything related to animation again\" after finishing [Hakubo](https://anilist.co/anime/98784/). He has become notorious for his incendiary behavior on Twitter, including calling fans of anime \"mentally disabled,\" discriminatory remarks about Chinese and Korean anime fans, and attacking his former cast members, which resulted in him being temporarily suspended from Twitter in 2018.",
