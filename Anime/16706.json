          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/64664693)\n\nYamamoto's interest in working in the anime industry piqued in high school after realizing how noticeable the difference in episodes were depending on the episode director in charge. One of his favourites shows included [Seisenshi Dunbine](https://anilist.co/anime/929/).\n\nIn the late '80s, he joined [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/) as a production assistant after finding out that it's how many of the studio's directors started off. There he met and studied under [Shuuji Iuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/115833/) on his shows [Madou King Granzort](https://anilist.co/anime/2818/) and [Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru](https://anilist.co/anime/4807/). Then after having gone freelance he got his first shot as a director as one of the three unit directors on Iuchi's [Ranma ½ film](https://anilist.co/anime/418/) in 1991.\n\nIn 2001, Yamamoto made his debut as a series director on [Shiawase Sou no Okojo-san](https://anilist.co/anime/2934/), soon after which he worked as the first director of the long-running [Keroro Gunsou](https://anilist.co/anime/516/).
