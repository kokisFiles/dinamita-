  "description": "Set in ancient Japan, involving many explicit steamy sex scenes. Shirou and his little brother are captured by bandits, and he is given two options: become the leader's sex toy, or watch his brother die. (And just wait 'til his brother grows up...sexy boy...) Unlike some other hardcore yaoi, this story *does* have a plot and can be rather sweet and sad at certain moments.",

Today she is one of the most popular Boys' Love authors.  Her doujinshi circle is called K2 Company. Since she got her start doing shonen manga, she was embarassed to write under her real name, so she wrote under \"Kazuma\", which is a man's name, but she decided to keep it when she started writing female-oriented stories.",
