  "description": "In a remote corner of the planet Arcana, Palme, a sentient android crafted from a mystical wood that is said to absorb the memories of the civilizations it roots in, is awakened by Koram, a wounded warrior from the Sol tribe. Entrusting him with the mystical 'Egg of the Roof', she implores Palme to take it to the legendary realm of Tamas.<br>\n<br>\nGalvanized with purpose for his existence, he accepts Koram's quest to deliver the relic to its source: the center of the planet, which is threatened by a malevolent and destructive force.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: ADV Films)",

After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",

After leaving the company he went freelance and participated in many works in different roles, ranging from key animator to episode director, before making his proper directorial debut with a short film titled Chicken Man & Red Head, which was a part of the [Robot Carnival](https://anilist.co/anime/2182/) anthology.\n\nNakamura revolutionized anime in the early '80s with his more realistic, extremely detailed and fluid style of animation. He is one of the few animators who has proven that he can successfully take on almost all of the creative burden on a project, proven in both his Robot Carnival short and episode 4 of [Hakkenden](https://anilist.co/anime/1822/).\n\nHis 2001 film, [A Tree of Palme](https://anilist.co/anime/1141/), was an official selection of the Berlin Film Festival.",

After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",

After leaving the company he went freelance and participated in many works in different roles, ranging from key animator to episode director, before making his proper directorial debut with a short film titled Chicken Man & Red Head, which was a part of the [Robot Carnival](https://anilist.co/anime/2182/) anthology.\n\nNakamura revolutionized anime in the early '80s with his more realistic, extremely detailed and fluid style of animation. He is one of the few animators who has proven that he can successfully take on almost all of the creative burden on a project, proven in both his Robot Carnival short and episode 4 of [Hakkenden](https://anilist.co/anime/1822/).\n\nHis 2001 film, [A Tree of Palme](https://anilist.co/anime/1141/), was an official selection of the Berlin Film Festival.",
