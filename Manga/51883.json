          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/KenAkamatsu) | [Website](http://www.ailove.net/main.html) | [Blog](https://kenakamatsu.hatenablog.com/) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Akamatsu.Ken) | [Tumblr](https://kenakamatsu.tumblr.com/)\n\nKen Akamatsu is a Japanese mangaka from Tokyo.   \n\nIn his teenage years, Akamatsu failed the entrance exam to Tokyo University, and applied for Film Study instead (it is speculated that this is where he got the idea for Love Hina). Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket (short for Comic Market, a comic convention bi-annually held in Japan). He used the pen name Awa Mizuno (水野亜和). Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His \"A Kid's Game for One Summer\" was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated.    \n\nAfter a big hit with A.I. Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga, Love Hina. The series appeared in Weekly Shonen Magazine and has been collected in eleven volumes (with fourteen volumes in total), which have sold over 6 million copies in Japan, and received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen in 2001.  Akamatsu had added elements of his own life experiences to the story, and this was said to have induced a unique feeling to the manga especially for Western readers, whose lack of familiarity with Japanese culture for the most part added to the effect. The series, published in America in 2002, was especially well received in many overseas countries - Akamatsu was surprised that even foreign readers found Love Hina to be \"cute\" and to their liking.    \n\nHe is now married to his wife 'Kanon' Akamatsu, who was previously a singer/idol.\n\nSince 2022, he has held a seat in the House of Councillors proportional representation block of the National Diet.",
