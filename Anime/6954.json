Renowned for a unique style of storytelling and prose, Nasu is amongst the most prominent visual novelists in Japan. \n\nTogether with high school classmate and friend, [Takeuchi Takashi](https://anilist.co/staff/99054/Takashi-Takeuchi), Nasu formed [TYPE-MOON](https://anilist.co/staff/97582) in 2000, originally as a doujin group to create the visual novel Tsukihime. It soon gained immense popularity, much of which is attributed to Nasu's unique style of storytelling. A sequel to Tsukihime, Kagetsu Tohya, was released on August 2001. \n\n54563 Kinokonasu is named after him",

Her father was a big fan of classical and opera music and always desired for Yuki to play the piano for him. Yuki eventually gained a love for music and a love for the piano. Yuki started out as an SE programmer, but changed to music in 1992. She made her grand debut with a female trio called \"[See-Saw](https://anilist.co/staff/104342).\"  In the years to come the group released six singles and two albums. \n\nYuki then went on to work on her solo career composing for artists and some TV, films, and games, such as _Blood: The Last Vampire_ in 2001, and _Xenosaga II_ and _III_. In 2001, Yuki's claim to fame came with the release of the anime [_NOIR_](https://anilist.co/anime/272). The soundtrack sold 50,000 copies. In 2002, she was brought on to project .hack to write the score to [_.hack//SIGN_](https://anilist.co/anime/48), along with vocalist [Chiaki Ishikawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101059) and New York singer [Emily Bindiger](https://anilist.co/staff/103845). Shortly after Yuki comprised an album of original and complied songs known as Fiction, working again with Emily Bindiger as well as _Xenosaga_ vocalist Deb Lyons.  \n\nYuki's other well-known works were for [_Mobile Suite Gundam Seed_](https://anilist.co/anime/93), which hit 5th on the Oricon Charts its first week, and selling over 200,000 copies.

In 2003, she formed the project [FictionJunction](https://anilist.co/staff/103691) in which pairs Yuki's songwriting and composition with different performing vocalists, first as separate solo works and later into a singular group.

Her father was a big fan of classical and opera music and always desired for Yuki to play the piano for him. Yuki eventually gained a love for music and a love for the piano. Yuki started out as an SE programmer, but changed to music in 1992. She made her grand debut with a female trio called \"[See-Saw](https://anilist.co/staff/104342).\"  In the years to come the group released six singles and two albums. \n\nYuki then went on to work on her solo career composing for artists and some TV, films, and games, such as _Blood: The Last Vampire_ in 2001, and _Xenosaga II_ and _III_. In 2001, Yuki's claim to fame came with the release of the anime [_NOIR_](https://anilist.co/anime/272). The soundtrack sold 50,000 copies. In 2002, she was brought on to project .hack to write the score to [_.hack//SIGN_](https://anilist.co/anime/48), along with vocalist [Chiaki Ishikawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101059) and New York singer [Emily Bindiger](https://anilist.co/staff/103845). Shortly after Yuki comprised an album of original and complied songs known as Fiction, working again with Emily Bindiger as well as _Xenosaga_ vocalist Deb Lyons.  \n\nYuki's other well-known works were for [_Mobile Suite Gundam Seed_](https://anilist.co/anime/93), which hit 5th on the Oricon Charts its first week, and selling over 200,000 copies. Yuki has also become known for her work on CLAMP's [_Tsubasa Chronicle_](https://anilist.co/anime/177) series, [movie](https://anilist.co/anime/807), and [OVAs](https://anilist.co/anime/2685). In 2003, she formed the project [FictionJunction](https://anilist.co/staff/103691) in which pairs Yuki's songwriting and composition with different performing vocalists, first as separate solo works and later into a singular group. In 2007, Yuki formed the band [Kalafina](https://anilist.co/staff/101975), with two partners from FictionJunction, Wakana Ootaki and [Keiko Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/104664), to perform for the anime [_Kara no Kyoukai_](https://anilist.co/anime/2593), further working on several others. Kalafina disbanded in 2018, with their final lineup including Wakana, Keiko, and [Hikaru](https://anilist.co/staff/168857).",

He has been affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/) since its establishment.\n\nBorn in Tokyo and raised in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, he discovered his passion for anime during middle school, inspired by classics like [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/Galaxy-Express-999/) and [Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/). It was in high school that he met a like-minded friend with a love for drawing, sparking his aspiration to become an animator. During those formative years, he actively participated in the art club, where he honed his skills and embarked on creating independent anime projects.\n\nAfter graduating from the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he joined Studio Wombat as an in-between animator. During his time at the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he shared the same class with notable contemporaries such as [Mitsuru Obunai](https://anilist.co/staff/103077/Mitsuru-Obunai), [Yutaka Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/101801/Yutaka-Nakamura), and [Junichi Fujisaku](https://anilist.co/staff/100423/Junichi-Fujisaku). His journey took a significant turn in 1999 when he played a pivotal role in the establishment of [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/ufotable). Gathering with visionaries like [Hikaru Kondou](https://anilist.co/staff/103076/Hikaru-Kondou) in an old apartment in North Ikebukuro, Tokyo, they laid the foundation for what would become a renowned animation studio. In 2009, he made a significant move to the newly opened ufotable Tokushima Studio, where he assumed a leadership role, overseeing and nurturing a team primarily composed of young talents.\n\nOriginally harboring aspirations of becoming a director, he navigated a path from being an animator to realizing his dream. Armed with experiences in key animation and directing, he marked his directorial debut with \"Hanaukyo Maid Team: La Verite.\" Following his move to ufotable Tokushima Studio, he assumed the position of chief of the directing department, leaving his mark on numerous episodes. In his directorial role, he approached each project with careful consideration, assigning cuts to the Tokushima Studio staff thoughtfully, illustrating his dedication and meticulous approach to his craft.",
