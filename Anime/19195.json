Their first single under this name, \"Rescue\", was written for the anime film Appleseed EX Machina.\n\nIn 2014, Takahashi would form the supergroup METAFIVE (initially known as Yukihiro Takahashi & Metafive)—the band's first single \"Split Spirit\" would later serve as an ending theme for Ghost in the Shell: Arise\n\nTakahashi died from brain cancer on January 14, 2023, at the age of 70.",

While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, Black Magic, which was published in the manga dōjinshi Atlas. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.\n\nThe result was best-selling manga Appleseed, a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of Black Magic and a second volume of Appleseed, he released Dominion in 1986. Two more volumes of Appleseed followed before he began work on Ghost in the Shell.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated again with Production I.G to co-create the original concept for the anime television series Shinreigari/Ghost Hound, Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with Production I.G began airing in April 2008, titled Real Drive.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
