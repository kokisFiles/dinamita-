He is also a member of the bands Venomstrip and FLOWER FLOWER.\n\n__Biography:__\nHe started playing the piano at the age of three, then later on as a third year college student, he started his professional career after being scouted by the Light Music Club. Following this he joined [Koichi Domoto's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koichi_Domoto) tour, whom he knew from college.\n\nHe's mostly known as the keyboardist to the four-piece rock band FLOWER FLOWER with the stage name mura☆jun, which he joined in 2013. In the band his name was mistakenly introduced as 松潤 (Matsujun) when referring to members, so  instead of his actual stage name mura☆jun the fans have nicknamed him as such.",
