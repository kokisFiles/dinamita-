He has stated in an interview that he was a member of his high school's track and field team and that he loves to watch baseball both emphasized in his hit manga Suzuka. He debuted in 1996 with the one-shot \"Half & Half\" in Fresh magazine. His two hits, Suzuka and Cross Over, both mixed the genres of sports with high school romance. Suzuka focused on track and field while Cross Over used basketball. It is also interesting to note that the main love interest of the male protagonists of several of his works are extremely similar in appearance, namely in Half and Half, Cross Over, Suzuka, and Kimi No Iru Machi. Seo was an assistant to Oushima Tsukasa, and studied under Fujio Fujiko and Soda Masahito.  In 2009 Seo designed the High School Girl Kimchi for Hokubi Construction food company.",

The series was later adapted into an anime. However, the anime adaption was cancelled before it could complete the series.\n\nIn 2003, he collected some of his one-shot titles in two volumes: Mashima-en- Vol.1 & 2. Those stories include, among others, Cocona, \"Xmas Hearts\" and \"Fairy Tail\", a sort of prototype for his last work.\n\nIn 2006, he began his now finished series, Fairy Tail, serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shonen Magazine. He also published the manga Monster Hunter Orage.\n\nHiro Mashima was a notable guest at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con. He has one daughter.\n\nHis artwork and [Oda Eiichiro](https://anilist.co/staff/96881/EiichiroOda)'s are greatly similar, but that is due to both of them being influenced largely by [Toriyama Akira](https://anilist.co/staff/96901/AkiraToriyama)'s work growing up.\n\nHis former assistant was [Yoshikawa Miki](https://anilist.co/staff/98703/MikiYoshikawa) author of Yankee-kun to Megane-chan.",
