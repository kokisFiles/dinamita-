Grant is also known for portraying Nojiko in One Piece, Altena in Noir, and Ryoko Subaru in Martian Successor Nadesico. Although appearing in ADV titles, she was an independent contractor, not an ADV employee. Grant currently works at FUNimation and Seraphim Digital.\n\nGrant enjoyed her role as Neon Genesis Evangelion's Asuka so much that she briefly reprised the character in the radio plays and fan-produced anime derived from the fanfiction series Neon Genesis Evangelion: R, as well as cosplaying as Asuka (in Asuka's familiar red EVA-02 plugsuit and her school uniform) at anime conventions.\n\nShe was married to [Matt Greenfield](https://anilist.co/staff/101497/), director, co-founder of ADV and also a voice actor. They divorced on January 4, 2018.",

          "description": "__[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nabeshin_afro)__\n\n__Shinichi Watanabe__ is a Japanese director, episode director and storyboard artist for anime, while also being a voice actor.\n\nShinichi is best known for his over-the-top adaption of Rikudo Koshi's [Excel Saga](https://anilist.co/anime/379/Heppoko-Jikken-Animation-Excel-Saga), in which he appears as the character Nabeshin. In addition to his appearance in Excel Saga and [Puni Puni Poemy](https://anilist.co/anime/564/Puni-PuniPoemii), his likeness has also appeared as NB in [Tenchi Muyo! GXP](https://anilist.co/anime/1133/Tenchi-Muyo-GXP), Inu-Afro in [Dotto Koni-Chan](https://anilist.co/anime/1684/Dotto-Konichan) and in small role in [Mahoromatic](https://anilist.co/anime/276/Mahoromatic). He also does an unmistakable cameo of Nabeshin, which can be seen in [Nurse Witch Komugi](https://anilist.co/anime/615/Nurse-Witch-Komugichan/), although Shinichi had nothing to do with that project. In addition he made an appearance in the show [EyeShield 21](https://anilist.co/anime/15/Eyeshield-21). More recently he made an appearance in episode 32 of [Hayate no Gotoku](https://anilist.co/anime/2026/Hayate-no-Gotoku).\n\nShinichi claims that the nickname Nabeshin (which is an obvious combination of \"nabe\" in Watanabe, and \"shin\" in Shinichi) came from God himself.\n\n<i>(Not to be confused with the director [Watanabe Shinichirou](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/Shinichirou-Watanabe), which is most known for directing Cowboy Bebop)</i>",

          "description": "John Ledford is an entrepreneur and leader in the North American anime industry. In 1992, he founded A.D. Vision (ADV), paving the way for other businesses and the exponential growth anime has had within North America. With ADV's success, Ledford turned his sights to making the imaginative world of anime even more accessible with Anime Network's founding, North America’s first cable TV network dedicated to anime. He later partnered with Kadokawa Publishing and began Newtype USA with translated Japanese content and exclusive U.S. material related to all things anime, manga, and model reviews. This endeavor expanded into ADV Manga, which obtained licensing and publishing rights for hundreds of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.\n\nIn 2008, Ledford founded a new anime-focused company called Sentai Filmworks (Sentai). Since its founding, Sentai provides thousands of hours of content across traditional and digital platforms. Sentai’s dedication to bringing captivating stories, including acclaimed titles such as Grave of the Fireflies, Ninja Scroll, and High School of the Dead to audiences, is ongoing.\n\nLedford’s most recent success is with the 2017 founding of the streaming service HIDIVE. Since launching, HIDIVE is now available via a web browser, mobile devices, gaming platforms, and more. HIDIVE offers new simulcasts every season, an ever-growing collection of dubs, and exclusive titles. The service features DUBCAST SM editions, early access local-language dubs of simulcasts directly produced by HIDIVE, as early as two weeks after the original Japanese broadcast.\n\nFor nearly thirty years now, Ledford continues his goal to further the expansion of anime and the Japanese culture as a whole.",
