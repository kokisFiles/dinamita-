Her works range from sweet and innocent to almost borderline-H. She loves big-chested girls with cute faces and wishes all her manga could feature them. She says that she relies deeply on her assistants, calls herself a trend whore, loves scandalous things, considers herself a foreigner otaku and a Disney maniac, likes to drink, and is in love with video/audio.\n\nShe left Shogakukan in 2007 because of alleged abuse from her editors and now works for Kadokawa and Shueisha.\n\nShinjo has stated in an interview that she most likely will not be writing shoujo manga again, and hereon create only BL manga or bishounen manga. The MC characters should be only males.",
