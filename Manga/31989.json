  "description": "Ch. 1-4 + Extra<br>\nThis story is about a relationship between a teacher and his student, Homura. It just so happens that Homura's older sister Kaori was the teacher's 1st girlfriend. Back then, the teacher would always use Homura as excuse to run away whenever something happened and he would never get in the \"mood\" whenever he was with Kaori. One day, he saw Homura's exam paper and noticed that Homura wrote \"I like you, sensei\" at the right end corner of it. Will he accept Homura's confession? <br><br>\nSide Story:<br>\nUnbreakable Bones:<br>\nThe side story is of two childhood friends who meet again after 14 years. One is a policeman now, and the other is an ex-delinquent who is working at a ramen store.",
