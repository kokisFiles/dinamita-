  "description": "In a parallel Japan, the government struggles to handle the urban guerrilla called \"Sects\". To confront Sects' activity, \"Shutokei\" (Metropolitan Police) was organized and its Special Armed Garrison \"Tokki-Tai: Kerberos\" standed at the front line with their heavy arms. Although Tokki-tai achieved a triumph over Sects, people started to oppose their violent and bloody measure. Politically isolated, Tokki-tai made a final decision on their own fate... ",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/oshii_mamoru)\n\nAn anime and live-action director, mostly known for the former, whose seminal titles include [Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer](https://anilist.co/anime/1921/), [Angel's Egg](https://anilist.co/anime/885/), the first two [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/1095/) films and the [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) films, as well as the Kerberos Saga universe of which [Jin-Roh](https://anilist.co/anime/570/) is a part.\n\nHis affinity for Euro arthouse cinema, his falling out with the Christian religion, and his fascination with the unsuccessful anti-occupation, pro-communist protest movement in postwar Japan shaped his unusual sensibilities. Recurring themes and aesthetics in his works include oppressive police states, unsuccessful protest movements, dysfunctional bureaucracies, political action that results in stasis, biblical scripture, and imagery, philosophical dilemmas, characters trapped in seemingly inescapable situations, the use of dialog as descriptive \"texture\" rather than a plot-driver, and otherwise Euro-arthouse pacing and storyboarding. He is both polarizing to mainstream audiences, and highly revered by cinephiles and Hollywood directors; his works have influenced Hollywood films such as Dark City, The Matrix, and Avatar.\n\n[Kenji Kamiyama](https://anilist.co/staff/100348/), an anime director also closely associated with [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), is his protégé.",

          "description": "A notable mechanical and character designer for both anime and tokusatsu series.\n\nHe aspired a career in the industry after having seen [Space Battleship Yamato](https://anilist.co/anime/1650/), a franchise in which he would eventually serve as a director [in 2012](https://anilist.co/anime/12029/). His career began in 1978, debuting as a mechanical designer on [Toushou Daimos](https://anilist.co/anime/2816/), designing the enemy robots. Few years later in 1981, he made his tokusatsu debut on Robot 8-chan.\n\nThe following decade he worked on industry shaping series such as [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/86/), [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/) and [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/). During this time he also had ties to Parallel Creation, a creative group led by sci-fi writer [Aritsune Toyota](https://anilist.co/staff/220367/). This led him to work as an illustrator on novels such as [Record of Lodoss War](https://anilist.co/manga/92655/), in which his designs were deeply influential for Japanese fantasy series.\n\nIn 2002, he directed [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), an anime original created by him. Izubuchi said that his attempt was to set a new standard for mecha anime, as well as to bring back aspects of '70s mecha shows like [Brave Raideen](https://anilist.co/anime/2128/).\n\nA trademark in his mechanical designs is the Buchi-hole (ブチ穴), a series of round holes embedded, usually in a cluster pattern of three holes above and two below, located somewhere on the mecha.",
