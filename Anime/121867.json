The group would continue to conceal their identities in future concerts as well.\n\nZutomayo released two more singles digitally before releasing their first EP, Tadashii Itsuwari Kara no Kishou, on November 14 in the same year, through record label EMI Records Japan.

He is also a member of the bands Venomstrip and FLOWER FLOWER.\n\n__Biography:__\nHe started playing the piano at the age of three, then later on as a third year college student, he started his professional career after being scouted by the Light Music Club. Following this he joined [Koichi Domoto's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koichi_Domoto) tour, whom he knew from college.\n\nHe's mostly known as the keyboardist to the four-piece rock band FLOWER FLOWER with the stage name mura☆jun, which he joined in 2013. In the band his name was mistakenly introduced as 松潤 (Matsujun) when referring to members, so  instead of his actual stage name mura☆jun the fans have nicknamed him as such.",
