With Trider G7, he was promoted from in-between to key animation.

After the end of Urusei Yatsura, he was selected as a character designer for the later series [Maison Ikkoku](https://anilist.co/anime/1453/), and has since been in charge of character design for many other works. In 1987, he won the 4th Japan Anime Awards in the Animation Director category.

Soon after, at the age of 19, he got his first major break when he landed the role of mecha designer on [Dancouga: Super Beast Machine God](https://anilist.co/anime/2255/). Not too long after, at the young age of 21, he was given his first directorial role by directing episodes 5 and 6 of the [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/) OVA series. \n\nOobari mainly likes to work within the sci-fi mecha and fighting genres. His designs are easily recognizable from the voluptuous female forms and well-toned pretty boys he tends to create to appeal to wide audiences. For references, he likes to use images of professional wrestlers and models. He is friends with fellow former animator and current freelance illustrator [Tsukasa Kotoboki](https://anilist.co/staff/97965/).\n\nHe wasn't originally interested in animation but was inspired by [Satoshi Urushihara](https://anilist.co/staff/98177/).",

          "description": "Best known as the creator of [Project A-Ko](https://anilist.co/anime/212/). He is particularly noted for his work during the ‘80s, going all out in [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/) and many OVAs and films such as [Outlanders](https://anilist.co/anime/1940/) and [Dirty Pair](https://anilist.co/anime/1796/). He is among the many [Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)-influenced animators of the ‘80s, and his work is recognizable from its wide-eyed characters, attention to anatomical detail, and characterful impact frames.\n\nInitially he wanted to be a mangaka, but enrolled in university instead after not being sure if he could make a living - though, he did drop out after a year. During his short lived time there, he was watching [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and had sent a letter to [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/) with the hopes of joining [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/). They weren’t accepting in-betweeners at this time, so a producer of theirs referred him to [Studio Live](https://anilist.co/studio/6460/), which he then joined after passing an entrance test in 1979. There he studied under the studio’s founder, [Toyoo Ashida](https://anilist.co/staff/110953/), and started gaining attention for his work on Urusei Yatsura.\n\nAfter working at [Studio Deen](https://anilist.co/studio/37/) for a while, he took part in the establishment of Studio Graviton alongside [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), [Shouichi Masuo](https://anilist.co/staff/133909/) and [Kouji Itou](https://anilist.co/staff/101166/). He then went freelance and worked regularly for [Studio Fantasia](https://anilist.co/studio/24/).\n\nLately he has shifted more and more towards directing and storyboarding rather than animating himself, often collaborating with his long-time friends [Yuuji Moriyama](https://anilist.co/staff/100658/) and [Noriyasu Yamauchi](https://anilist.co/staff/112903/).",

His animation style includes using exaggerating motion, manipulating gravity and balance with use of different perspective shots, lots of rapid camera movement and unconventional angles. With his boldly distorted and vigorous drawing style, his cuts are unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nHe has worked as an animator for over thirty years. His early work in the 80's mainly consisted of action and effects cuts. He bounced around several studios, including [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and [Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/). His early cuts include [Gall Force 2: Destruction](https://anilist.co/anime/2061/), for which he animated a laser beam with a distinctly loose and vivid sense of movement. With its smooth animation and wavy motion pattern, the cut has a lively fluidity to it that can be seen as the first step towards Oohira's current distinctive visuality. He used the same approach on his smoke effects for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and a flood for [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/). His style truly came into fruition when he started applying this to solid objects – especially people. The earliest such case is his cut in the fourth episode in [The Hakkenden: Shin Shou](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/). The Oohira \"wobble,\" is perhaps his most distinct trademark: the animated objects expand and compress in a wobbling manner.\n\nAspired to become an animator after having seen [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/)'s work on [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/).\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\n",

After graduating from high school, he joined Studio Musashi, which was recruiting staff through newspaper ads. His first work as an official in-betweener was for [Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace](https://anilist.co/anime/1986/). He then moved to Studio Cockpit, where he worked on [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/), before moving on to NeoMedia. There he worked on [Trider G7](https://anilist.co/anime/4536/), [Doraemon](https://anilist.co/anime/2471/), and [Belle and Sebastian](https://anilist.co/anime/3836/). With Trider G7, he was promoted from in-between to key animation. He left NeoMedia in 1982 to work as a freelancer, starting with [Combat Mecha Xabungle](https://anilist.co/anime/2254/) and [Makyou Densetsu Acrobunch](https://anilist.co/anime/3880/).\n\nThe popular anime [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/), in which he participated from the same year, was Moriyama's breakthrough work. With this series, he made his debut as an animation director and storyboard artist, and was in charge of the opening animation for the first time, joining a group of popular animators overnight. Chief director [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/), who was responsible for Urusei Yatsura, expected him to become a partner, so Moriyama tried his hand at manga as well by illustrating a manga written by Oshii that was serialized in the Animage magazine in 1984 called Todo no Tsumari. After the end of Urusei Yatsura, he was selected as a character designer for the later series [Maison Ikkoku](https://anilist.co/anime/1453/), and has since been in charge of character design for many other works. In 1987, he won the 4th Japan Anime Awards in the Animation Director category. After that, he shifted from animating to directing.\nAfter that he participated in many works, mainly Chaos Project , Studio Pierrot , and Studio Hibari and then has seated at Studio Hibari's Lerche. \n\nMoriyama often works under one of his many pen-names.\n\n",
