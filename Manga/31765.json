Her work <i>Nanairo Magic</i> won the 11th Kodansha Manga Awards Shoujo Category on 1987.\n\nAfter she had a car accident and was in the hospital, Asagiri realized that she should write the stories she always wanted to do rather than the shoujo-manga she was \"forced to do\". She then started to do adult stuff.\n\nShe died on Oct 27, 2018 from severe pneumonia.",
