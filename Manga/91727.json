  "description": "In this very zany take on the dramatic series by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara, the end of the century… wasn't so bad, actually. A very special and brave Holy Emperor, Souther, wants to become more \"involved\" and to be on \"friendly terms\" with the noble Kenshiro & his posse. Especially Kenshiro. Due to his very outgoing nature, he also crashes the homes of his other buddies, often when they especially don't want him to show up!\n<br><br>\nJoin Souther as he releases his feelings in heart-throbbing, mind-bending confessions, settles complex and engrossing territorial disputes with deep and intricate consequences, enjoys the simple and introspective pleasures of a quiet dinner, and climbs the top of the rough and brutal pyramid that is the idol world - with the help of his best buddies, of course! Maybe even Kenshiro will be there - who knows!\n<br><br>\nBy the time it got its anime in 2015, Strawberry Flavor had sold over 1 million copies in Japan. The anime was composed of 2-minute long, abridged adaptations of select chapters from the first three volumes. They were placed after the main episodes of DD Fist of the North Star season 2.\n<br><br>\nEvery volume also contains at least one gaiden (side story). These gaiden are drawn in Yukito's (the elder sister of Yukito Imouto) normal artstyle, and expand on characters who did not receive gaiden during the Hokuto Gaiden period in the late 2000's.\n<br><br>\nGaiden List:<br>\nVolume 1: Spade, Club & Diamond, Heart<br>\nVolume 2: Souther<br>\nVolume 3: Shuren & Huey<br>\nVolume 4: Fudo<br>\nVolume 5: Yuda<br>\nVolume 6: Shin<br>\nVolume 7: Falco & friends, Ein<br>\nVolume 8: Ogai<br>\nVolume 9: Devil Rebirth",

          "description": "__Yoshiyuki Okamura__, also known as **Buronson** (武論尊) or **Sho Fumimura** (史村 翔, Fumimura Shō), is a Japanese manga writer most known by his famous work Hokuto no Ken, known in English as Fist of the North Star.  He graduated from the Japanese Air Force Training School in 1967 and served as an Air Force radar mechanic. In 1969 he discharged from the Japanese Navy and was soon hired by Hiroshi Motomiya as a manga assistant. He started his manga writing career when he wrote the script of Pink Punch: Miyabi in 1972, drawn by Goro Sakai. In 1975 Buronson wrote his first big hit The Doberman Detective, drawn by Shinji Hiramatsu. The famous Hokuto no Ken made its debute as Buronson's greatest hit in 1983, drawn by Tetsuo Hara. In 1989 his story Ourou was released as a manga serialized in Animal Magazine, drawn by Kentarou Miura, and in 1990 a sequel entitled Ourou Den was released by the same manga artist. Buronson also collaborated with the manga artist Ryoichi Ikegami in many works as Strain (manga) , Human (manga) and the famous Sanctuary (manga). Among his other major works are The Phantom Gang, with art by Kaoru Shintani.    Buronson was mainly influenced by movies such as Bruce Lee's, and Mad Max.    The nickname Buronson is a tribute to the American actor Charles Bronson, whose way of growing the mustache was imitated by Yoshiyuki Okamura too.  ",
