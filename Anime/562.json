Fujishima originally intended to be a draftsman, but took the editorial role after failing to get a drafting apprenticeship. He later became assistant to manga artist [Tatsuya Egawa](https://anilist.co/staff/98034/Tatsuya-Egawa) in the production of the Making Be Free! manga, and in 1986 began his first original manga series You're Under Arrest. His second manga series Oh My Goddess!, also translated as Ah! My Goddess, is Fujishima's most famous work, which made him a household name in Japan. He is also well known as the character designer for several games in the Tales series and Sakura Wars.\n\nHe is known for his love of automobiles and motorcycles, and several of his series and their characters reflect this, such as in éX-Driver and Oh My Goddess!.\n\nOn June 29, 2016, the famous 20-year-old cosplayer Nekomu Otogi announced her marriage to Fujishima as well as her pregnancy on her Twitter page.

He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work. Another of his most important work is often said to be [Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar](https://anilist.co/anime/890/), and the [sequel](https://anilist.co/anime/1382/) following it.\n\nIn 2002, he won the first Tokyo Anime Award for Best Music for his work on [Overman King Gainer](https://anilist.co/anime/1792/).",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/64664693)\n\nYamamoto's interest in working in the anime industry piqued in high school after realizing how noticeable the difference in episodes were depending on the episode director in charge. One of his favourites shows included [Seisenshi Dunbine](https://anilist.co/anime/929/).\n\nIn the late '80s, he joined [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/) as a production assistant after finding out that it's how many of the studio's directors started off. There he met and studied under [Shuuji Iuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/115833/) on his shows [Madou King Granzort](https://anilist.co/anime/2818/) and [Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru](https://anilist.co/anime/4807/). Then after having gone freelance he got his first shot as a director as one of the three unit directors on Iuchi's [Ranma ½ film](https://anilist.co/anime/418/) in 1991.\n\nIn 2001, Yamamoto made his debut as a series director on [Shiawase Sou no Okojo-san](https://anilist.co/anime/2934/), soon after which he worked as the first director of the long-running [Keroro Gunsou](https://anilist.co/anime/516/). In 2006 he directed the well-received [NHK ni Youkoso!](https://anilist.co/anime/1210/)\n\nMore recent directorial works of his include [Yama no Susume](https://anilist.co/anime/14355/) and [Shounen Maid](https://anilist.co/anime/21321/).",
