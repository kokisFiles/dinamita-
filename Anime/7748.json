  "description": "My name is Sawaguchi Mai. I always get myself involved with my classmate, Kawamura Reo.<br>\nReo is pretty short and has silky hair... In short, she's cute. But sometimes, she can be really obstinate.<br>\nI'm trying to do my best to get her to get along with the rest of the class, but since we're both headstrong we always end up fighting.<br>\nIt's so frustrating, especially since she can't do anything without me around!<br><br>\nBut whenever I talk to her, Reo always acts like I'm bothering her. I wonder if she hates me...<br>\nBut then, just when I got all depressed Reo came up to me and told me,<br>\n\"You've got it all wrong! I love you, Mai! I love you so much!\"<br>\nHer confession completely took me by surprise. Could it be that I'm in love with Reo too!?<br><br>\n(Source: dlsite.com)",
