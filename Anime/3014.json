Set in an imaginative future, the story describes the first encounter between Yang and Reinhard and discusses how heroes are born.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Lensman was the first series he worked on as an animator.

He then founded [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/) together with fellow former Mushi Pro employees, [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/). At Madhouse, he debuted as a director on 1984's [Lensman](https://anilist.co/anime/2770/), albeit still jointly with the more experienced [Kazunori Hirokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170070/). Kawajiri made his full-fledged directorial debuts in 1987, with [Wicked City](https://anilist.co/anime/1107/) and Running Man, the latter being a short film a part of an anthology collection, [Neo Tokyo](https://anilist.co/anime/1951/). Wicked City was originally meant to be a short film as well, but the producers were impressed enough in Kawajiri to let him turn it into a feature-length film. After these, Kawajiri directed [the third installment](https://anilist.co/anime/2998/) of Madhouse's adaptations of the highly acclaimed [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/) manga series, [Phoenix](https://anilist.co/manga/31325/).\n\nWicked City received critical and commercial success upon its release, giving Kawajiri more creative freedom. As a result of this he began writing the script for his own original film, [Ninja Scroll](https://anilist.co/anime/617/), a movie set in feudal Japan following a mercenary swordsman battling a team of ninjas with supernatural powers who are intent on overthrowing the Tokugawa shogunate. After the movie's international release, Kawajiri's status as a director received global recognition and he went on to direct multiple other works in the late '90s and early '00s.\n\nIn recent years, Kawajiri has taken a step back from directing, but has been guest appearing as a storyboard artist all over the industry.",

He composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers.    Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood in Salzburg. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17 he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position, always composing abundantly. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of Mozart's death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/136171134)\n\nA long-serving anime producer, as well as a founder of [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/) and [Studio M2](https://anilist.co/studio/6137/). He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
