  "description": "The year is 2032. With the advancement of medical technology humanity has grown into a more technologically driven creature, creating a breed of cyborg citizen. Along with the development of cybernetics the world has seen rapid development in the field of artificial intelligence, making androids a commercially viable venture.<br>\n<br>\nA recent string of murders perpetrated by a prototype female android has drawn the attention of Section 9, a unit specializing in counter cyber-terrorism. With none of the victims' families pressing charges, suspicions arise regarding the nature of the androids and their production.<br>\n<br>\nMonths have passed since the end of the Puppet Master incident, and with the Major still missing investigative duties fall to her cyborg commando partner Batou and his newly recruited biological partner, Togusa. Can the two overcome their differences and discover the truth behind this string of murders?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Bandai Entertainment)",

While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, Black Magic, which was published in the manga dōjinshi Atlas. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.\n\nThe result was best-selling manga Appleseed, a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of Black Magic and a second volume of Appleseed, he released Dominion in 1986. Two more volumes of Appleseed followed before he began work on Ghost in the Shell.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated again with Production I.G to co-create the original concept for the anime television series Shinreigari/Ghost Hound, Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with Production I.G began airing in April 2008, titled Real Drive.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Recurring themes and aesthetics in his works include oppressive police states, unsuccessful protest movements, dysfunctional bureaucracies, political action that results in stasis, biblical scripture, and imagery, philosophical dilemmas, characters trapped in seemingly inescapable situations, the use of dialog as descriptive \"texture\" rather than a plot-driver, and otherwise Euro-arthouse pacing and storyboarding. He is both polarizing to mainstream audiences, and highly revered by cinephiles and Hollywood directors; his works have influenced Hollywood films such as Dark City, The Matrix, and Avatar.\n\n[Kenji Kamiyama](https://anilist.co/staff/100348/), an anime director also closely associated with [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), is his protégé.",

However, he dropped out after half a year. With a few friends, he created the band Muse, playing fusion rock and participating in music competitions. Through competing in such contests, the band members became technically competent to enter the music industry and decided to part ways.\n\nAfter leaving Muse, Kawai Kenji began composing music for commercials in his home studio. While recording music for [Yuji Mitsuya](https://anilist.co/staff/95874/) he met music director Naoko Asari, who advised him to compose anime soundtracks. Some of his most famous anime soundtracks can be found in [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/1288/), [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), [Fate/Stay Night](https://anilist.co/anime/356/), [When They Cry](https://anilist.co/anime/934/) and more recently in [Mob Psycho 100](https://anilist.co/anime/21507/).\n\nHe has worked on several projects with the director [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) and has written scores for all of Hideo Nakata's films. Kenji Kawai's music has received the Annie award and Hong Kong Film Award in 2005, for [Ghost in The Shell 2: Innocence](https://anilist.co/anime/468/) he was nominated for an Annie award.\n\nFollowing his success as an anime music composer, he became involved in live action movies. He contributed music to horror films: Ring, Ring 2, Dark Water, Japanese-Polish science-fiction film Avalon and the Hong Kong film Seven Swords.\n\nFor the music found in Seven Swords and A Battle of Wits he was nominated for Best Original Film Score Awards at both the 25th and 26th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2006 and 2007.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

He developed this further in the extremely fluid and active full animation of [Tobe! Kujira no Peek](https://anilist.co/anime/2314/). Gosenzo was the first anime to place shadows accurately according to light source and to use blurring during fast action. His way of animating arms hanging loosely was often imitated in the ‘90s. Utsunomiya draws movement from memory without external references, whereas animators like [Oohira](https://anilist.co/staff/103893/) and  [Hashimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/103894/) often filmed themselves acting out material for reference. Kinetic accuracy is the goal but drawings are highly simplified and clean.\n\nSimplified style of animation and detailed action makes his scenes stand out in stark contrast in certain films such as [Battle Royal High School](https://anilist.co/anime/3625/). Able to breathe a miraculous amount of life into the simplest of actions such as simply talking while seated. Reportedly storyboarded the third episode of [The Hakkenden: Shin Shou](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/) in widescreen format on his own initiative. Able to create dynamic action at lower frame rates like 3 frames/cel. His more current work focuses on the subtle, unconscious movements of everyday actions, omitted as superfluous in supposedly 'realistic' animation.\n\n(Source: Pelleas)",

Suzuki is renowned as one of Japan's most successful producers after the enormous national box office success of many Ghibli films.\n\nHe was instrumental in getting the [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/) anime made and helped establish Studio Ghibli shortly after the film's release. Miyazaki has stated, \"If it were not for Mr. Suzuki, there wouldn't have been Studio Ghibli.\" Ghibli co-founder [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), has acknowledged the pivotal role of Suzuki in bringing the Nausicaä manga series into the world and used nearly identical words as Miyazaki to acknowledge Suzuki’s essential role in the creation of Studio Ghibli. Takahata also credits Suzuki for his steadfast support of Miyazaki and has cited Suzuki’s responsibility for making his friendship with Miyazaki endure.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He later joined [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/), where he debuted as the studio's youngest animation director on [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). A few years later in 1994, he got to handle the character designs for the first time on [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/), a TV series directed by [Akiyuki Shinbou](https://anilist.co/staff/100089/).\n\nAfter having left Gainax, Honda participated in most of [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)'s works. Perhaps most notably as a character designer on [Millenium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), a role which was originally planned to be [Hideki Hamasu](https://anilist.co/staff/125820/)'s, but was given to him due to Hamasu having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. Honda also designed the characters for [Mitsuo Iso](https://anilist.co/staff/100151/)'s [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/).\n\nIn 2006, Honda joined [Studio Khara](https://anilist.co/studio/47/) and reprised his vital staff roles in the [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/2759/) franchise. The same year he made his long-awaited debut in a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) film, working as a key animator on [Tales from Earthsea](https://anilist.co/anime/1829/) and then again on [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/). His work received high praise by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) for expressing the characters' individuality through their movements.\n\nNicknamed as \"Master\" (師匠, Shishou), by [Takahiro Kishida](https://anilist.co/staff/101403/) during the production of [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/).

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/885163337809395712)\n\nAn irreplaceable member of the Japanese animation industry.\n\nInoue is an animator of the realist school whose skills are among the best in the world. He is known to often handle immense amounts of work in the titles he partakes in. Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",

His animation style includes using exaggerating motion, manipulating gravity and balance with use of different perspective shots, lots of rapid camera movement and unconventional angles. With his boldly distorted and vigorous drawing style, his cuts are unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nHe has worked as an animator for over thirty years. His early work in the 80's mainly consisted of action and effects cuts. He bounced around several studios, including [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and [Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/). His early cuts include [Gall Force 2: Destruction](https://anilist.co/anime/2061/), for which he animated a laser beam with a distinctly loose and vivid sense of movement. With its smooth animation and wavy motion pattern, the cut has a lively fluidity to it that can be seen as the first step towards Oohira's current distinctive visuality. He used the same approach on his smoke effects for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and a flood for [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/). His style truly came into fruition when he started applying this to solid objects – especially people. The earliest such case is his cut in the fourth episode in [The Hakkenden: Shin Shou](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/). The Oohira \"wobble,\" is perhaps his most distinct trademark: the animated objects expand and compress in a wobbling manner.\n\nAspired to become an animator after having seen [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/)'s work on [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/).\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\n",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ogura_koubou)\n\nIn 1977, Ogura joined *Kobayashi Production* and learned the ropes of art direction under [Shichirou Kobayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/103964/Shichirou-Kobayashi). In 1983 he left and established Studio Fuga together with Kouji Oono and [Toshiharu Mizutani](https://anilist.co/staff/121908/Toshiharu-Mizutani). There he eventually left as well and formed his own 'Ogura Kobo' at Production I.G., where he trains newer art directors. He continues to be a major presence at Production I.G. as one of their most prominent art directors.\n\nOgura's style is, similar to Kobayashi's, rooted in imposing architecture, ambient colors, and Western perspectives versus traditional Japanese isometric perspectives. Ogura's backgrounds are usually urban in setting and has a less saturated color palette, and uses more cool than warm colors. Ogura's fantastical, European Kobayashi influence is easily seen in [Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/Ouritsu-Uchuugun-Honneamise-no-Tsubasa/), and his later work has remained distinctly metropolitan, something that can be seen even in the rural [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/).\n",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/170696565)\n\nShiotani grew up admiring Ghibli films and Ghost in the Shell, so he decided to enroll in an animation school in order to be able to participate in the creating process of anime. After graduating he joined [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/) becoming one of their most promising young animators. \n\nAfter some years spent climbing to the position of animation director on series such as [Windy Tales](https://anilist.co/anime/1524/Windy-Tales/), he left his first creative mark on the industry by directing, storyboarding and supervising [Blood+](https://anilist.co/anime/150/)'s kaleidoscopic 3rd Opening. \n\nHe had his directorial debut with [Tokyo Marble Chocolate](https://anilist.co/anime/3088/), OVA produced as a collaboration between Production I.G. and BMG Japan in commemoration of both companies' 20th anniversaries. The OVA was awarded the Grand Prize in the Feature Film Category of the 12th Seoul International Cartoon & Animation Festival in 2008.\n\nShiotani is most famous for being the director of the [Psycho-Pass](https://anilist.co/anime/13601/) series. Initially planned with a post-apocalyptic setting, the concept changed after the Great East Japan Earthquake and evolved into its final form. The series is inspired by detective crime stories and sci-fi (Minority Report, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Patlabor) with the precise intent of exploring societal problems. \n\n",
