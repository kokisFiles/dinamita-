          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/佐藤勝) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Sato)\n\nMasaru Satou was a Japanese film score composer.\n\nWhile studying at the National Music Academy, Satou came under the influence of Fumio Hayasaka, [Akira Kurosawa](https://anilist.co/staff/100099/)'s regular composer for his earlier films. He became a pupil of Hayasaka's, studying film scoring with him at Toho Studios, and working on the orchestration of Seven Samurai (1954). When the older composer died suddenly in 1955, Toho assigned Satou to finish the scores for New Tales of the Taira Clan, and Record of a Living Being. His first original score was for Godzilla Raids Again in 1955. He wrote the music to all of Kurosawa's movies for the next decade, including Throne of Blood, The Bad Sleep Well, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, and Red Beard. In addition to Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Satou worked with Hideo Gosha.\n\nHis work in the realm of popular film continued throughout his career, composing the scores to Ishirou Honda's Half Human (1955) and The H-Man (1958), Senkichi Taniguchi's The Lost World of Sinbad (1963), and three Jun Fukuda-directed Godzilla films: Ebirah, Horror of the Deep (1966), Son of Godzilla (1967), and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974). During his 44-year association with Toho Studios, he wrote more than 300 film scores. He also created the music for such Japanese television series as The Water Margin. He was nominated for Best Music at the 15th Japan Academy Prize.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
