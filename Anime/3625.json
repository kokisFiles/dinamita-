  "description": "Hyoudo Riki is just an ordinary guy who likes to wear a tiger mask while Kung Fu fighting, which means he fits in real well at BATTLE ROYAL HIGH SCHOOL!<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately for Riki, he's the doppelganger in our world of Byoudo, Master of the Dark Realm, and when a dimension gate opens between the two worlds, the evil Fairy Master tricks Byoudo into making an attempt to conquer out beautiful, and better lit, world.<br>\n<br>\nNow poor Riki is semi-possessed by his opposite number, and the minions of the Fairy Master are mutating his classmates into hideous lustful monsters. To make matters worse, all the inter-dimensional commotion has attracted the attention of a sword-happy exorcist and the heroic Zankan of the Space-Time Police!<br>\n<br>\nWhich all means that Riki is about to take one bitch of a mid-term. The course is survival, and forget \"Pass/Fail.\" This test is graded \"Live/Die!\"<br>\n<br>\n(Source: AnimEigo)",

          "description": "Ichirou Itano is a Japanese director, producer, animator and mechanical designer. He has worked in a number of science fiction anime series, especially mecha-themed ones. Director of works such as [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/), [Battle Royal High School](https://anilist.co/anime/3625/), [Gantz](https://anilist.co/anime/384/) and more.\n\nItano is best known among anime fans for a style of action scene that he developed, usually nicknamed \"Itano Circus\" by fans; it refers to a highly stylized and acrobatic method of depicting aerial combat and dogfights in many anime.\n\nThe production in [Space Runaway Ideon](https://anilist.co/anime/930/) became a hot topic in the anime industry, and it came to be called this by comparing the brisk movement of mechanics to the air acrobatics of the circus. The technique became more famous when Itano used it for the \"dogfights\" depicted in [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) anime TV series in 1982. It's characterized by detailed, fluid shading of the mecha, the close-range acrobatic moves the dueling fighters make in combat, as well as twisting contrails left by fighters and missiles. It is also commonly used in specific reference to an attack where a mecha or spaceship launches a large swarm of guided missiles with meticulously animated spiraling smoke trails and erratic trajectories and its target is repeatedly dodging those missiles at a high speed.\n\nAccording to him, [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), [Masami Gotou](https://anilist.co/staff/129865/) and [Yasushi Muraki](https://anilist.co/staff/105090/) are the only animators to have fully mastered Itano Circus.",

          "description": "Ichirou Itano is a Japanese director, producer, animator and mechanical designer. He has worked in a number of science fiction anime series, especially mecha-themed ones. Director of works such as [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/), [Battle Royal High School](https://anilist.co/anime/3625/), [Gantz](https://anilist.co/anime/384/) and more.\n\nItano is best known among anime fans for a style of action scene that he developed, usually nicknamed \"Itano Circus\" by fans; it refers to a highly stylized and acrobatic method of depicting aerial combat and dogfights in many anime.\n\nThe production in [Space Runaway Ideon](https://anilist.co/anime/930/) became a hot topic in the anime industry, and it came to be called this by comparing the brisk movement of mechanics to the air acrobatics of the circus. The technique became more famous when Itano used it for the \"dogfights\" depicted in [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) anime TV series in 1982. It's characterized by detailed, fluid shading of the mecha, the close-range acrobatic moves the dueling fighters make in combat, as well as twisting contrails left by fighters and missiles. It is also commonly used in specific reference to an attack where a mecha or spaceship launches a large swarm of guided missiles with meticulously animated spiraling smoke trails and erratic trajectories and its target is repeatedly dodging those missiles at a high speed.\n\nAccording to him, [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), [Masami Gotou](https://anilist.co/staff/129865/) and [Yasushi Muraki](https://anilist.co/staff/105090/) are the only animators to have fully mastered Itano Circus.",

          "description": "__Alma Mater:__ Yamaguchi Prefectural Ube High School\n\n[Website](http://www.khara.co.jp/hideakianno/)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHideaki Anno is known as one of Japan's celebrity anime directors. In 1984 he founded Studio Gainax along with [Takami Akai](https://anilist.co/staff/102032/Takami-Akai) and [Hiroyuki Yamaga](https://anilist.co/staff/100988/Hiroyuki-Yamaga). As Anno grew up with anime and 8mm experimental film, he brought a mindset of homage and intertextuality novel to anime at the time. He is well known in Japan and has branched out into live action film making, acting, and voice acting in addition to his anime works.\n\n__Style:__\nAnno is a first-rate effects animator, known for drawing very realistic scenes of explosions and debris that bears resemblance to atomic bomb test footage. He was mentored by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/Hayao-Miyazaki) during the making of [*Nausicaä*](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausicaa/), where he drew the giant insect monsters. Though he's done excellent work on a wide variety of shows, his crowning masterpiece of animation is generally accepted to be the [rocket launch sequence](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/110674) in [Wings of the Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/Ouritsu-Uchuugun-Honneamise-no-Tsubasa/). Another great showcase of his skills are [the legendary explosions of DAICON IV](https://sakugabooru.com/data/9586fb64f2d2f687805c8409cedc7ec7.webm).\n\nAs a director, Anno has made a career out of subverting expectations in established genres and tropes. The signatures to his direction are rhythmic jump cuts, [intertitles](https://i.imgur.com/j2Di92w.png), minimal camera movement and avant-garde techniques like emulsion scratches and found footage photomontage. He's also fond of using *Ozuesque* cutaways of urban scenery, particularly things related to infrastructure and technology, such as [power lines](https://i.imgur.com/prfHWLa.jpg). Anno's works are known for being dialogue-driven and for beginning with a light atmosphere before transitioning into the dire. \n\nIn addition to Miyazaki, Anno lists [Ichiro Itano](https://anilist.co/staff/103268/Ichiro-Itano) and [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/Yoshiyuki-Tomino) as artistic influences. He is also a professed fan of Japanese New Wave director [Kihachi Okamoto](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0645477/). Anno is close friends with [Kunihiko Ikuhara](https://anilist.co/staff/100082/Kunihiko-Ikuhara), which fueled rumors that Ikuhara was the model for [*Nagisa Kaworu*](https://anilist.co/character/1261/Kaworu-Nagisa) in Evangelion. Both share a jaundiced view of the anime market and a love for the Japanese avant-garde.\n\n__Biography:__\nAnno established his name as a director with his debut, [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster!](https://anilist.co/anime/949/Gunbuster/), as the 6-episode space opera built up a reputation, in particular for its high-stakes monochrome finale. He would follow this up with being chief director for [Fushigi no Umi no Nadia](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/Fushigi-no-Umi-no-Nadia/), but was absent for an infamous stretch of episodes called the Island arc, where Shinji Higuchi was asked to take over. Due to Nadia's rampant success, the television broadcaster requested another cour of episodes. Anno was working on the series for 18 hours a day at this point.\n\nAnno suffered from depression and became dispirited about anime production after not being permitted the creative freedom he wanted with *Nadia*, which fueled inspiration for one of the most important and popular works of the medium: [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/). It remains a highly unique take on the mecha genre, casting the lead as indecisive and ineffectual instead of the typical enthusiastic, hotheaded hero. The show became infamous for its plot-driven episodes of the first half giving way to increasingly abstract character studies and deconstructions in the second. This reached its pinnacle in the finale episodes which were, due to a mixture of financial issues and Anno skirting the deadline, so experimental that they received significant negative reception. In response, Anno directed a feature-length sequel called [The End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/End-of-Evangelion/) that, though sporting higher production values, was no less experimental and surrealist than the series proper.\n\nEvangelion's massive financial success helped spurn more interest in late night anime, causing a boom in the market. Up to this day it remains a highly influential show, with many visual and narrative references to be found in contemporary anime. \n\nAfter Evangelion, Anno handled the adaptation of shoujo romance [Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/). Despite its more straightforward narrative, its aesthetic was highly distinctive in its use of stills and cropped framings to emulate the experience of reading a shoujo manga, with Anno even filming pages of the manga in a few extreme cases. \n\nIn 2007 Anno decided to leave studio Gainax after several years of poor production and financial mismanagement, and established studio Khara, and began working on the Rebuild of Evangelion film series, which are lavishly animated reboots/continuations of the TV series.\n\n__Non-anime credits:__\n- Writer and director for ''Love & Pop''\n- Writer and director for ''Ritual''\n- Writer and director for ''Ryusei-kacho''\n- Writer and director for ''Cutie Honey (live-action movie)''\n- Writer and director for ''Shin Godzilla''\n- Writer for ''Shin Ultraman''\n- Writer and director for ''Shin Kamen Rider''",
