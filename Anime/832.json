          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/298477416)\n\nOobari began his career when he joined the animation studio Ashi Production, working on titles like [Tokusou Kihei Dorvack](https://anilist.co/anime/5143/) and [Sei Juushi Bismarck](https://anilist.co/anime/2361/). Soon after, at the age of 19, he got his first major break when he landed the role of mecha designer on [Dancouga: Super Beast Machine God](https://anilist.co/anime/2255/). Not too long after, at the young age of 21, he was given his first directorial role by directing episodes 5 and 6 of the [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/) OVA series. \n\nOobari mainly likes to work within the sci-fi mecha and fighting genres. His designs are easily recognizable from the voluptuous female forms and well-toned pretty boys he tends to create to appeal to wide audiences. For references, he likes to use images of professional wrestlers and models. He is friends with fellow former animator and current freelance illustrator [Tsukasa Kotoboki](https://anilist.co/staff/97965/).\n\nHe wasn't originally interested in animation but was inspired by [Satoshi Urushihara](https://anilist.co/staff/98177/).",

In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",
