          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/298477416)\n\nOobari began his career when he joined the animation studio Ashi Production, working on titles like [Tokusou Kihei Dorvack](https://anilist.co/anime/5143/) and [Sei Juushi Bismarck](https://anilist.co/anime/2361/). Soon after, at the age of 19, he got his first major break when he landed the role of mecha designer on [Dancouga: Super Beast Machine God](https://anilist.co/anime/2255/). Not too long after, at the young age of 21, he was given his first directorial role by directing episodes 5 and 6 of the [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/) OVA series. \n\nOobari mainly likes to work within the sci-fi mecha and fighting genres. His designs are easily recognizable from the voluptuous female forms and well-toned pretty boys he tends to create to appeal to wide audiences. For references, he likes to use images of professional wrestlers and models. He is friends with fellow former animator and current freelance illustrator [Tsukasa Kotoboki](https://anilist.co/staff/97965/).\n\nHe wasn't originally interested in animation but was inspired by [Satoshi Urushihara](https://anilist.co/staff/98177/).",
