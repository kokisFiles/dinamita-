He wanted to work with esteemed Director [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki) since [Gamba's Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/Gambas-Adventure/) was particularly striking to him.\n\nInterested in effects animation, he cites [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada) and [Kazuhide Tomonaga](https://anilist.co/staff/110219/Kazuhide-Tomonaga) as major influences. He had his first breakthrough as animator on [Space Adventure Cobra](https://anilist.co/anime/2451/Space-Adventure-Cobra/) and [Golgo 13: The Professional](https://anilist.co/anime/1760/), in which his effects work and fun character animation was highly praised. Later his work became increasingly more experimental, combining his animation with intricate art design and CGI.\n\nDuring his period at Annapuru he befriended [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/Takashi-Nakamura) and the two worked on several projects together even after leaving the studio. [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Ootomo) recognized his talent and Morimoto became a key figure in many of his works. He debuted as Director on [Robot Carnival](https://anilist.co/anime/2182/Robot-Carnival/).\n\nIn 1985 he founded [Studio 4°C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/) alongside former Ghibli producer [Eiko Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/103607/Tanaka-Eiko). He would later leave the studio in 2011.\n\nMarried to [Atsuko Fukushima](https://anilist.co/staff/118789/).",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/885163337809395712)\n\nAn irreplaceable member of the Japanese animation industry.\n\nInoue is an animator of the realist school whose skills are among the best in the world. He is known to often handle immense amounts of work in the titles he partakes in. Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/kojimorimoto) | [Website](http://www.kojimorimoto.com)\n\nFan of anime such as [Lupin the 3rd](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/Lupin-the-3rd/) and [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/Future-Boy-Conan/), after graduating from the Osaka Designers' college, he joined [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE) and soon after Studio [Annapuru](https://anilist.co/studio/583/Annapuru). He wanted to work with esteemed Director [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki) since [Gamba's Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/Gambas-Adventure/) was particularly striking to him.\n\nInterested in effects animation, he cites [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada) and [Kazuhide Tomonaga](https://anilist.co/staff/110219/Kazuhide-Tomonaga) as major influences. He had his first breakthrough as animator on [Space Adventure Cobra](https://anilist.co/anime/2451/Space-Adventure-Cobra/) and [Golgo 13: The Professional](https://anilist.co/anime/1760/), in which his effects work and fun character animation was highly praised. Later his work became increasingly more experimental, combining his animation with intricate art design and CGI.\n\nDuring his period at Annapuru he befriended [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/Takashi-Nakamura) and the two worked on several projects together even after leaving the studio. [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Ootomo) recognized his talent and Morimoto became a key figure in many of his works. He debuted as Director on [Robot Carnival](https://anilist.co/anime/2182/Robot-Carnival/).\n\nIn 1985 he founded [Studio 4°C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/) alongside former Ghibli producer [Eiko Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/103607/Tanaka-Eiko). He would later leave the studio in 2011.\n\nMarried to [Atsuko Fukushima](https://anilist.co/staff/118789/).",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/885163337809395712)\n\nAn irreplaceable member of the Japanese animation industry.\n\nInoue is an animator of the realist school whose skills are among the best in the world. He is known to often handle immense amounts of work in the titles he partakes in. Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",
