  "description": "The Japanese government was rescued from the brink of financial collapse by the Sovereign Wealth Fund. For its citizens, however, life has not improved and unemployment, crime, suicide, and despair are rampant. Kimimaro, raised by his maternal aunt after the disappearance of his father and the death of his mother, is a scholarship student whose only dream is to live a stable, ordinary life. One day he meets a man who offers him a large sum of money if he will allow his \"future\" to be held as collateral. From then on his fate is radically altered as he's drawn into a mysterious realm known as the Financial District, where he must compete in weekly tournaments called \"deals\" in order to keep his money and avoid losing his future.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He quit music school as an elementary school student and, until his high school years, studied under Iwashita Tetsuya, who taught him how to use multiple recordings and synthesizers. He became a composer in his later high school years, through the various efforts made by himself and his teacher.\n\nIn 1985, he won a prize at the Kanagawa Arts Festival choral composition competition, while in the late 1980s, after entering Tokyo University of the Arts, he studied contemporary music under Satou Shin and Aoshima Hiroshi. While still being a student, he received the New Artist Award from the Japan Contemporary Music Association. He later started working as an arranger after graduating from college.\n\nIn 1999, he participated in the music unit \"Smart Drug\" with Koizumi Hiroshi, who was responsible for doing the composition and playing the guitar, and Okamoto Sayori who would later rename to Hiyoko, who was responsible for doing the lyrics and vocals. He participated under the alias \"Taque,\" where he was responsible for the arrangement and playing the keyboard. They released three CDs from 1999 to 2002.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "<b>Introduction:</b>\nSchool Food Punishment was a Japanese four-piece rock/pop/electronica band. They were first signed under record label July Records/United Asia Entertainment (2007-2007), then under Fiveman Army Rocks (2008-2009) and then finally signed under Sony Music Japan's Epic Records Japan prior to their breakup in June 2012. The lyrics of each of the band's songs from 2004-2012 were written by lead vocalist and guitarist Yumi Uchimura.\n\n<b>Biography:</b>\nThe band was founded on October 2004 by [Uchimura Yumi](https://anilist.co/staff/152896/), while their first live performance took place in December the same year. In 2007, their debut album, \"<i>school food is good food</i>\", was released. In 2008, both of their songs, \"feedback\" and \"Futari Umi no Soko\" were featured as theme songs to the Japanese television drama <i>Joshidaisei Kaikeishi no Jikenbo</i>, while their mini-album \"<i>Riff-rain</i>\" was released by Tower Records and sold out in under a week. They also performed in numerous live concerts, including FM802, part of the Minami Wheel 2008 live event, and the J-Wave Live event, part of the Tokyo Real Eyes Live Supernova.\n\nIn 2009, they signed onto their first major record label, Sony Music Japan's Epic Records Japan division. Their major label debut was the song \"<a href=\"https://anidb.net/song/4695\">futuristic imagination</a>\", which was used as the ending theme song to the <a href=\"https://anilist.co/staff/100348/Kenji-Kamiyama\">Kenji Kamiyama</a> directed anime television series <i><a href=\"https://anilist.co/anime/5630/Higashi-no-Eden/\">Eden of the East</a></i>, airing on the highly rated noitaminA timeslot on Fuji TV. Among their first projects, was contributing to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_and_Mary\">Judy and Mary</a>'s <i>15th Anniversary Tribute Album</i>, in which they covered the band's \"<i>Brand New Wave Upper Ground</i>\" song, with their performance praised by sources such as <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Japan_Times\">The Japan Times</a></i> for having been the highlight of the album, and for having evoked Judy and Mary's songwriting and musical values.\n\nIn 2012, the band announced that it would be going on an indefinite hiatus. The band said the decision came as a result of discussions between the four members.\n\nOn June 11, 2012 the band announced that they had broken up due to vocalist [Uchimura Yumi](https://anilist.co/staff/152896/) having left the band.\n\nFollowing the disbandment of the band School Food Punishment, [Uchimura Yumi](https://anilist.co/staff/152896/), producer [Eguchi Ryo](https://anilist.co/staff/109383/) and touring guitarist Mitsui Ritsuo joined the band <a href=\"https://anilist.co/staff/151900/la-la-larks\">la la larks</a> known as the successor to the band School Food Punishment.
