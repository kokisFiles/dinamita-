          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/akiniina)\n\nDebuted with a comic parody of Project A-ko around 1989. Shortly after, he contributed to a number of comic magazines like Minori Shobou's Comic Zenon and Hobby Japan's Comic Master, but didn't manage to make a name for himself. Throughout the 1990s, he worked for a number of adult comic magazines, such as Wani Magazine's Comic Kairakuten, France Shoin's Comic Papipo Garden and Celadon Byblos's Colorful Bee. Starting in 1992, he contributed a large number of covers for Comic Papipo Garden. Around the same time, he would find success with his adult comic \"Kita no Kuni kara Konnichiwa\", selling over 100,000 copies and getting a CD drama adaptation. He would go on to marry the voice actress of the main heroine.\n\nThroughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, he continued to have his works published in a number of comic magazines, many of which changed publishers, leading to a number of disagreements between him and his editorial departments, ultimately leading to him changing his alias in 2002. Around 2004, his Mazinger Z doujin works would be noticed by Go Nagai, leading to the creation of his most notable work, the Mazinger Angels series, and its subsequent sequel shortly after.\n\nIn June of 2008, he revealed on his blog to be struggling with acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nHis wife and daughter both worked as voice actresses, associated with Aoni Production and Kirin Pro, respectively.\n",
