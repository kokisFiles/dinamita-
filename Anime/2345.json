  "description": "Only one episode of this was partially completed, the released version containing numerous examples of animation that is missing in-between frames. The story as such concerned the arrival of the real Chojin as he/she (a hermaphrodite) makes moves to wipe out all life on Earth.<br><br>\nInterestingly, the setup for the show was far more heavily connected with the first two, more popular, chapters in the Urotsukidoji saga, with appearances by Nagumo and Akemi (unseen since the early episodes of Part III), and redesigned character models that more closely resembled the earlier episodes. Some of the less popular characters introduced in chapters III and IV, particularly Buju, were nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless, such strategies did little to get this final saga off the ground and the story was shelved.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Several of Maeda's works have been used as a basis for Original Video Animations including the well known La Blue Girl, Adventure Kid, Demon Beast Invasion, Demon Warrior Koji and his most famous work, Urotsukidōji (Legend of the Overfiend). One interviewer commented that Urotsukidōji \"firmly placed him in the history books - in Japan and abroad - as the pioneer of the genre known as hentai, or perverted\".  Maeda is proud of his role in popularizing the genre and in a blog interview stated that he would like \"Tentacle Master\" inscribed on his tombstone.  (Source: Wikipedia)",
