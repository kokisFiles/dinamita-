Furthermore, acclaimed animation studio Studio 4°C adapted Tekkonkinkreet into an animated feature film in 2006, and in 2014 Tatsunoko Production produced an anime adaptation of Ping Pong, which was directed by Masaaki Yuasa.\n\nIn 2007 he received an Excellence Award for manga at the Japan Media Arts Festival for the art of Takemitsu Zamurai.\n\nTaiyo is the cousin of [Santa Inoue](https://anilist.co/staff/97830), another critically acclaimed mangaka.\nHis wife [Saho Touno](https://anilist.co/staff/174013) is also a mangaka and assists Taiyou with erasing, coloring, and occasional editorial guidance.",

At the age of 20, Kensuke first came in contact with the electronic music world known as techno. \n\nIn 2007, he would start his solo career under the stage name agraph, this is when he started to create his own electronic music.

His third album titled The Shader was released in 2016.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

His animation style includes using exaggerating motion, manipulating gravity and balance with use of different perspective shots, lots of rapid camera movement and unconventional angles. With his boldly distorted and vigorous drawing style, his cuts are unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nHe has worked as an animator for over thirty years. His early work in the 80's mainly consisted of action and effects cuts. He bounced around several studios, including [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and [Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/). His early cuts include [Gall Force 2: Destruction](https://anilist.co/anime/2061/), for which he animated a laser beam with a distinctly loose and vivid sense of movement. With its smooth animation and wavy motion pattern, the cut has a lively fluidity to it that can be seen as the first step towards Oohira's current distinctive visuality. He used the same approach on his smoke effects for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and a flood for [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/). His style truly came into fruition when he started applying this to solid objects – especially people. The earliest such case is his cut in the fourth episode in [The Hakkenden: Shin Shou](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/). The Oohira \"wobble,\" is perhaps his most distinct trademark: the animated objects expand and compress in a wobbling manner.\n\nAspired to become an animator after having seen [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/)'s work on [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/).\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\n",

His animation style includes using exaggerating motion, manipulating gravity and balance with use of different perspective shots, lots of rapid camera movement and unconventional angles. With his boldly distorted and vigorous drawing style, his cuts are unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nHe has worked as an animator for over thirty years. His early work in the 80's mainly consisted of action and effects cuts. He bounced around several studios, including [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and [Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/). His early cuts include [Gall Force 2: Destruction](https://anilist.co/anime/2061/), for which he animated a laser beam with a distinctly loose and vivid sense of movement. With its smooth animation and wavy motion pattern, the cut has a lively fluidity to it that can be seen as the first step towards Oohira's current distinctive visuality. He used the same approach on his smoke effects for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and a flood for [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/). His style truly came into fruition when he started applying this to solid objects – especially people. The earliest such case is his cut in the fourth episode in [The Hakkenden: Shin Shou](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/).

In 2010, he graduated from *Gobelins* - a Parisian animation school. He was a co-director of two animated shorts, *Fenrir* and *Le Royaume* and designing the backgrounds for the video game *Rayman Legends*, which he gained some acclaim for. However, Aymeric is best known for his backgrounds on [Masaki Yuaasa](https://anilist.co/staff/100068/Masaaki-Yuasa)'s and [Eunyoung Choi](https://anilist.co/staff/115088/Eunyoung-Choi)'s projects. \n\nAymeric's tendency towards vibrant, slightly warped urban locales was uniquely suited to the Yuasa School's direction. Thought he generally uses Photoshop for cleanly executed lineart in his backgrounds, Aymeric's backgrounds in Ping Pong The Animation were all hand drawn in pencil.\n\nHe worked as a concept artist at Riot Games in Los Angeles, but as per September 2019, he left. He now currently works as Production Designer at Sony Pictures Animation.\n",
