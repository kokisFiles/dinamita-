In 2001, Yuki's claim to fame came with the release of the anime [_NOIR_](https://anilist.co/anime/272). The soundtrack sold 50,000 copies.

For example, Wakana is in charge of the main vocals in Oblivious and Lacrimosa, while the main vocals in Aria are done by Hikaru. In others songs each of them sings a stanza.
