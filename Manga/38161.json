          "description": "Maki Enjouji is a Japanese manga artist. Some of her works, such as Happy Marriage!? and Private Prince, have been published in French and German by Kazé and Tokyopop. Editorial Ivrea has released the Spanish version of Private Prince in 2011, which is still ongoing. Happy Marriage!? will be published in English under VIZ Media’s Shojo Beat imprint on 6 August 2013.\n\nHer debut as a manga artist was a one-shot called Fu Junai that was published in 2004 in the special issue of April of the Japanese josei manga magazine Petit Comic published by Shogakukan. Since then, she published all her works to date in this magazine. Fu Junai was also the first manga of the author published in Germany, where the title was translated as “Private Love Stories”, in April 2009. Enjouji is currently working on the story Dear Brother!, released in October 2011. Her hobbies include cats and traveling.\n\nHer works stand out for their thematic feature of the josei genre, which is love and sexual relations between adult men and women in a humorous and dramatic tone.",
