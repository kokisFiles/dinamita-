  "description": "Very popular sword &amp; sorcery shounen series with a mixed dose of Japanese mythology and some futuristic themes. According to myth, the evil emperor Miroku will be dethroned by a young hero who's also destined to open the gateway that connects the human world to the legendary land of Agalta. When a son with tremendous powers was born to Miroku, the infant's body was cut up into eight parts to prevent the prophecy from becoming true and given to Miroku's eight evil generals for safekeeping. Then the poor baby was cast into the river but luckily was found by Tatara who gave it both its name, Madara and artificial limbs to compensate for the missing ones. Madara grew up with a girl named Kirin and when he was 15, he was given the sword Kusanagi and told to go and get his real body parts back. Along the way, he discovers the truth about his father, his lineage and his own powers. Madara also finds out that there are 3 other contenders for this prophesized hero role: Kaos, Seishinja and his own older twin brother, Kage-ou. So the series is about Madara's adventures to bring down Miroku and his final decision when he reaches the legendary portals. <br><br>\n[Source: PRISM] <br>",

In addition to his work with manga he is a critic, essayist, and author of several successful non-fiction books on Japanese popular and “otaku” sub-cultures. One of his first animation script works was Maho no Rouge Lipstick, an adult lolicon OVA. Otsuka was also the editor for the bishoujo lolicon manga series Petit Apple Pie.    \n\nIn the 80s, Otsuka was editor-in-chief of MANGA BURIKKO, a leading women's manga magazine where he pioneered research on the “otaku” sub-culture in modern Japan. In 1988 he published \"Manga no Koro\" (The Structure of Comics), a serious study of Japanese comics and their social significance. Also as critic, Otsuka Eiji, summarized the case of the Japanese red army's 1972 murders as a conflict between the masculine and the feminine principles as they were both embodied by women and against women (Otsuka, 1994).",
