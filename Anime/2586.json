He was also one of the founding members of [Oh!

Shioyama later became a freelancer, doing work for [Tatsunoko Pro](https://anilist.co/studio/103/) and working on many projects for [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/) as an animation director. Shioyama's first project as a character designer was for [Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3](https://anilist.co/anime/3305/), which anime director [Ryousuke Takahashi](https://anilist.co/staff/100957/) praised. He then worked on such shows as [Fang of the Sun Dougram](https://anilist.co/anime/2257/), [Panzer World Galient](https://anilist.co/anime/5153/), and [Ronin Warriors](https://anilist.co/anime/1264/) as both character designer and animation director. His and Takahashi's designs epitomized Sunrise's work in the '80s.\n\nOn April 13, 2017, a fire occurred at Shioyama's apartment in Misato, sadly killing both him and his wife.",

          "description": "A notable mechanical and character designer for both anime and tokusatsu series.\n\nHe aspired a career in the industry after having seen [Space Battleship Yamato](https://anilist.co/anime/1650/), a franchise in which he would eventually serve as a director [in 2012](https://anilist.co/anime/12029/). His career began in 1978, debuting as a mechanical designer on [Toushou Daimos](https://anilist.co/anime/2816/), designing the enemy robots. Few years later in 1981, he made his tokusatsu debut on Robot 8-chan.\n\nThe following decade he worked on industry shaping series such as [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/86/), [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/) and [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/). During this time he also had ties to Parallel Creation, a creative group led by sci-fi writer [Aritsune Toyota](https://anilist.co/staff/220367/). This led him to work as an illustrator on novels such as [Record of Lodoss War](https://anilist.co/manga/92655/), in which his designs were deeply influential for Japanese fantasy series.\n\nIn 2002, he directed [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), an anime original created by him. Izubuchi said that his attempt was to set a new standard for mecha anime, as well as to bring back aspects of '70s mecha shows like [Brave Raideen](https://anilist.co/anime/2128/).\n\nA trademark in his mechanical designs is the Buchi-hole (ブチ穴), a series of round holes embedded, usually in a cluster pattern of three holes above and two below, located somewhere on the mecha.",

          "description": "A co-founder and a board member of [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/).\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Kawamoto was first employed in the making and designing of precision machinery. During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/). Some of the more recent works he has provided designs for include [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/), [Ghost Slayers Ayashi](https://anilist.co/anime/1587/), [Noragami](https://anilist.co/anime/20447/) and [Kekkai Sensen](https://anilist.co/anime/20727/).\n\n**Non-anime staff credits:**\n~!\n- Character Design - \"Gigantic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam A year of War\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91 Formula Senki 0122\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Return of Zion\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Senki\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE Be Eliminate Yesterday\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Wonder Project J\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Robot Alchemic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Assistant Chief Animation Director - \"OVER THE MONOCHROME RAINBOW\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation for \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam PERFECT ONE YEAR WAR\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Serial Experiments Lain\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Spiral Zone\" (ep 5)!~",
