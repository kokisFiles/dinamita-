          "description": "__[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nabeshin_afro)__\n\n__Shinichi Watanabe__ is a Japanese director, episode director and storyboard artist for anime, while also being a voice actor.\n\nShinichi is best known for his over-the-top adaption of Rikudo Koshi's [Excel Saga](https://anilist.co/anime/379/Heppoko-Jikken-Animation-Excel-Saga), in which he appears as the character Nabeshin. In addition to his appearance in Excel Saga and [Puni Puni Poemy](https://anilist.co/anime/564/Puni-PuniPoemii), his likeness has also appeared as NB in [Tenchi Muyo! GXP](https://anilist.co/anime/1133/Tenchi-Muyo-GXP), Inu-Afro in [Dotto Koni-Chan](https://anilist.co/anime/1684/Dotto-Konichan) and in small role in [Mahoromatic](https://anilist.co/anime/276/Mahoromatic). He also does an unmistakable cameo of Nabeshin, which can be seen in [Nurse Witch Komugi](https://anilist.co/anime/615/Nurse-Witch-Komugichan/), although Shinichi had nothing to do with that project. In addition he made an appearance in the show [EyeShield 21](https://anilist.co/anime/15/Eyeshield-21). More recently he made an appearance in episode 32 of [Hayate no Gotoku](https://anilist.co/anime/2026/Hayate-no-Gotoku).\n\nShinichi claims that the nickname Nabeshin (which is an obvious combination of \"nabe\" in Watanabe, and \"shin\" in Shinichi) came from God himself.\n\n<i>(Not to be confused with the director [Watanabe Shinichirou](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/Shinichirou-Watanabe), which is most known for directing Cowboy Bebop)</i>",
