  "description": "To the south of Japan, there lies a lush green island called Southern Cross Isle. One night, a boy by the name of Takuto Tsunashi washes up on the shore of the island. Having swum from the mainland alone and without any possessions, he enrolls in the senior high level in the school on the island - Southern Cross High School.<br><br>\r\nWith his bright and positive personality, he starts to mix with various students in the school and builds relationships with many of them, including Wako Agemaki and Sugata Shindou. But this school hides a deep secret. There are sleeping giants hidden under the ground called \"Cybodies\".<br><br>\r\nThere are about 20 of these giants, and they are just some of the various secrets kept by everyone on the island: The secret movements of the mysterious organization known as Glittering Crux. The songs of the shrine maidens. And even Takuto himself will soon come to embrace a great secret...<br><br>\r\nThis island in the southern territories surrounded by the blue sea and the blue skies is the stage where the \"Eulogy of Youth\" filled with love, dreams and friendships, will begin.

          "description": "[Twitter (shiimai)](https://twitter.com/shiimai) | [Sakugabooru](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=hiroyuki_imaishi+) \n\nHiroyuki Imaishi was born in 1971, in Tokyo. He joined studio Gainax after graduating from Tama University of Arts. Imaishi later left the studio to establish his own studio, Trigger, where he still works to this day.\n\nImaishi made a name for himself on *Hideaki Anno*'s [Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/). He did key animation and storyboards for several episodes, with episode 19 being a standout for its unorthodox paper cutout animation. His presence injected some stylized levity into Anno's shoujo drama.\n\nImaishi started as an animator heavily influenced by [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/Masahito-Yamashita) and [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada). He draws \nwith a similar warping of perspective and with characters snapping into discrete poses, mixed with cartoony devices reminiscent of A Pro's work on [Dokonjo Gaeru](https://anilist.co/anime/5618/Dokonjou-Gaeru/), of which Imaishi is a fan. He also tends to draw his characters enveloped in speedlines, with strongly defined eyes and eyebrows, rectangular jawlines, and gummy, gritted teeth. His cuts are willfully limited, eliminating transitions between poses and using fast looping for comedic effect.\n\nImaishi became one of Gainax' premier directors after Kare Kano. His directorial aesthetic is heavily informed by his animation. Elisions of graphic space become elisions of cinematic space and time.The interplay of moving and still planes, forceful use of text, and extreme variations in size are other major components of his direction. His shot compositions are usually very busy due to crunching in as much of his characters into the frame as possible, and he has no problem reducing action scenes to pure visual abstraction, like rendering clashing figures as a few pencil lines. He is known to employ [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki)-esque tricks like triple takes and postcard shots in his work. His storyboards are rough, improvised, and lacking in detail. He's a fan of American director [Robert Rodriguez](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/) and [John Woo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/), and loves referencing classic anime and film in his works.\n\nHis first solo directorial effort was the Production I.G. OVA [Dead Leaves](https://anilist.co/anime/974/Dead-Leaves/) which would set the stage for Imaishi's later works: crude, anarchic, and heterogeneous characters positioned against a homogenizing totalitarian force. Dead Leaves uses pillarboxing and text in a manner recalling stylized comic books. Imaishi served as character designer and animation director on the OVA so the animation is steeped in his neo-Kamada idiom more than any of his other works.\n\nImaishi left Gainax and formed studio Trigger with [Masahiko Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/Masahiko-Ootsuka) in 2011, bringing over several major animators to the new studio. His debut TV work with Trigger was 2013's [Kill la Kill](https://anilist.co/anime/18679/Kill-la-Kill/), that similarly to Gurren Lagann, freely and extensively referenced anime history. Despite being a broadly popular series overseas, it is Imaishi's most controversial work to date, not only for its extreme levels of fanservice, but also because it suffered damaging production problems: rewrites of the script, cost cutting animation shortcuts, and a restrictive schedule. \n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/hiroyuki-imaishi/)",

          "description": "Akira Amemiya is an animator and up-and-coming director best known for directing [SSSS.GRIDMAN](https://anilist.co/anime/99424/SSSSGRIDMAN) and being Studio Trigger founder [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/Hiroyuki-Imaishi)'s protege. Amemiya's [animation and directing](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mini-imaishi.mp4) is very similar to Imaishi's yet is less chaotic and contains more 'retro' devices like impact frames and multi-tonal shading, drawing a lot of inspiration from [Masami Obari](https://anilist.co/staff/100660/Masami-Obari). For these reasons he was frequently typecasted for old school pose-heavy mecha combat.\n\nAmemiya is a nerdy director whose anime often heavily references other series and artists he loves, sometimes even replicating Obari's [animation sequences](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dangaioh2.mp4) and [layouts](https://i.imgur.com/nTRdM4K.jpg), [Transformer](https://twitter.com/SSS_SGRID/status/1051063114022572033)'s color designs, and Hideaki Anno's [establishing shots](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/welcome-to-the-anno-class.jpg) as well as long-lingering framing. Amemiya called Anno's [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/) his [favorite series before](https://i.imgur.com/nEYK186.png). Between his ode-heavy artistry he interjects personality with [subtle details](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/what-kind-of-brand-is-TOMATO-LIFE-tho.jpg), visual gags, and repurposing tonally contrasting homages into a different context.\n\nAmemiya graduated from Tokyo University of Technology and was part of the university's anime research society. During his time there he became heavily influenced by Osaka University's anime research club [Group CAS](https://twitter.com/group_cas). At the time [Toshiyuki Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/107357/Toshiyuki-Satou) was part of the group, while [Ikehata Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/120505/Ikehata-Hiroshi) visited regularly. After a bit of indie work Amemiya joined studio Gainax and climbed up the hierarchy: from clean-up to animation direction, onto storyboarding and episode directing, until after joining studio Trigger and co-directing Kill la Kill finally having the credentials to debut with his own series.\n\nHe is married to animator [Megumi Kouno](https://anilist.co/staff/120602/Megumi-Kouno).\n\n",

Some of his recognizable traits include camera shaking, blurs, and bending and stretching high-speed objects. His fights are praised for its weighty, intense choreographies that are heavy on impact frames. His signature trait is drawing debris as simple cubes, consequentially named \"Yutapon Cubes,\" which are stylistic and easy to draw.
