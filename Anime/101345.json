He quit music school as an elementary school student and, until his high school years, studied under Iwashita Tetsuya, who taught him how to use multiple recordings and synthesizers. He became a composer in his later high school years, through the various efforts made by himself and his teacher.\n\nIn 1985, he won a prize at the Kanagawa Arts Festival choral composition competition, while in the late 1980s, after entering Tokyo University of the Arts, he studied contemporary music under Satou Shin and Aoshima Hiroshi. While still being a student, he received the New Artist Award from the Japan Contemporary Music Association. He later started working as an arranger after graduating from college.\n\nIn 1999, he participated in the music unit \"Smart Drug\" with Koizumi Hiroshi, who was responsible for doing the composition and playing the guitar, and Okamoto Sayori who would later rename to Hiyoko, who was responsible for doing the lyrics and vocals. He participated under the alias \"Taque,\" where he was responsible for the arrangement and playing the keyboard. They released three CDs from 1999 to 2002.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Tm Network (stylized TM NETWORK) was a Japanese pop/rock band. It consisted of Tetsuya Komuro (Keyboardist), Takashi Utsunomiya (Vocalist) and Naoto Kine (Guitarist).  They were original members of a band call Speedway during their school days. The three of them formed TM NETWORK. Their name is commonly thought to stand for “Time Machine Network”. However, on September 6th 2006 on an episode of Trivia no Izumi claimed that TM actually stands for \"Tama\", the district from Tokyo they all came from. While Trivia no Izumi claims that TM stands for \"Tama\" Tetsuya Komuro himself as early as 1984 on the show LiveG, has said that the TM stands for Time Machine.  They changed their name to TMN in 1990, and broke up in 1994. They had reunited under their old name of TM NETWORK in 1999.  Members: Tetsuya Komuro (小室哲哉) born November 27, 1958 in Fuchu, Tokyo - keyboard, composition, arrangement, lyrics, producer, chorus Takashi Utsunomiya (宇都宮隆) born October 25, 1957 - main vocals, chorus Naoto Kine (木根尚登) born September 26, 1957 - guitar, composition, piano, harmonica, chorus",

He began his professional career in 1985, and is internationally known for the _[City Hunter 2](https://anilist.co/anime/1471/City-Hunter-2)_ ending theme '[Super Girl](https://anidb.net/song/30791)', and for the _[Space Dandy](https://anilist.co/anime/20057/SpaceDandy)_ opening theme '[Viva Namida](https://anidb.net/song/64362)'.\n\n__Biography:__\nYasuyuki was born in Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan in 1965, he is the oldest of two children. His father worked for Air France, and as a result, his family moved frequently throughout Japan, resulting in him rotating between seven elementary schools and junior high schools. He attended Niigata Higashi High School and formed his first band there, but dropped out in the 11th grade to pursue a musical career while working part-time at the nightclub Hacoban. after sending out numerous demo tapes, and doing composing work for other artists, he was finally signed by Epic Sony in 1986.\n\nYasuyuki was highly successful in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, first promoted to the world as a teen idol. He also claimed that during this time he was most inspired by the singers [Seiko Matsuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko_Matsuda) and [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)). He starred in the film _Peach I'll Do Anything For You_ (Peach-どんなことをしてほしいのぼくに) alongside Kahori Fujii and Kazuhiko Kanayama. In 1996, he fell back from the media and performing in general, and started to focus more on producing other artists, including Meg and Chara.\n\nYasuyuki was arrested in 2003 for possession of stimulant drugs, but released after pleading that the drugs were a necessary medicine. His record contract with Epic Sony was terminated by the company, and he was later signed by Universal. In April 2005, he was arrested again, but this time for attempting to use cocaine in a Shibuya record store bathroom, and for this he was sentenced to two years in prison. When returning in 2007, he started a comeback visually similar to his 1980s look, but was arrested again on February 5, 2008 for possession of crystal meth. He was sentenced to another two years in prison, and he then proceeded to return live in Tokyo in 2010. He began releasing demos on his official Myspace page, back then.\n\nIn 2011, Yasuyuki begun an official tour again and released a two-part self cover album. Etiquette Pink and Etiquette Purple. He returned to producing other artists and touring, and begun to speak openly about becoming fully sober. In 2013, he released his first single in six years, titled '[Viva Namida](https://anidb.net/song/64362)', which was revealed to become the opening theme to the Shinichiro Watanabe's _[Space Dandy](https://anilist.co/anime/20057/SpaceDandy/staff)_. In the music video for this single, an anime version of Yasuyuki dances and sings along with the Space Dandy cast. In 2014 he toured Japan.\n\nIn 2017, he alongside [TeddyLoid](https://anilist.co/staff/130673/TeddyLoid), [Kenshi Yonezu](https://anilist.co/staff/126835/Kenshi-Yonezu) and [DAOKO](https://anilist.co/staff/123235/DAOKO) released a 14 track album titled \"[Thank You Blue](https://anidb.net/collection/11407)\", featuring the ending theme song from [Takayanagi Shigehito](https://anilist.co/staff/105553)'s directed [Kekkai Sensen & Beyond](https://anilist.co/anime/97886/Kekkai-Sensen--BEYOND/) titled '[Step Up Love](https://anidb.net/song/93942)'.\n\n(Source: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuyuki_Okamura))",
