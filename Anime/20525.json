          "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nKeiji Fujiwara was a Japanese actor and voice actor.\n\nEven though he was born in Tokyo, he spent the majority of his childhood in Iwate Prefecture. In high school, he handled vocals in a band he formed with his friend Kotaro Furuichi, future guitarist of rock band The Collectors.\n\nAt around 18 years of age, he moved back to Tokyo on his own and joined the Bungakuza acting school. He spent the 1980s performing in several theater troupes while working odd jobs. Fujiwara was introduced to his first voice acting agency, Ken Production, in the early 1990s. The first TV anime in which he appeared as a regular was [Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/970/), but his breakout role was [Hiroshi Nohara](https://anilist.co/character/33466/) in [Crayon Shin-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/966/).\n\nIn November 2006, he left Ken Production and founded his own agency, Air Agency. Aside from talent management, the company went on to release original drama and situation CDs through its child company Air Label, as well as produce live events. In 2010, Fujiwara made his own sound directorial debut in Kakkokawaii Sengen.\n\nIn August 2016, Air Agency announced that he was going on hiatus in order to undergo medical treatment for a then-unspecified illness. He officially resumed work in June 2017. On April 16, 2020, Air Agency announced that Fujiwara had passed away due to cancer on April 12, 2020.\n\n__Trivia:__\n- He was a regular lecturer at the Japan Newart College since 2008\n- In the live action field, he was most known for dubbing actor Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man/Tony Stark.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ohkowai/status/1446500402275373056)\n\nTakumi Yokota is an animator and character designer that is currently freelance. He was formerly affiliated with ufotable, Anime International Company (AIC), and Shaft.\n\nAfter graduating from university from the Faculty of Law department, he joined ufotable as a production assistant. He stated in an interview with Akiba Souken in 2019, that while watching movies and anime at the library in his third or fourth year of job hunting, he fell in love with the work Patlabor: The Mobile Police, directed by Mamoru Oshii. And while watching Oshii's interview, he decided that he wanted to become a director, and when he was researching on how to become a director, he found out that one of the paths of becoming a director is by starting out as a production assistant; and so he applied as a production assistant at ufotable. He later left ufotable due to various reasons and described himself as a NEET for almost half a year after departing from ufotable. After more than three months of being a NEET, he thought to himself that he really needed to get a job, and then remembered his time as a production assistant at ufotable. While still working as a production assistant at ufotable, a conversation with an animator at ufotable stuck with him, and thought subsequently: \"Let's go back to anime again!\" And in 2007, he applied as an animator at Anime International Company (AIC) when he saw that the studio was hiring 20 new animators, and got the position. He made his debut as an animator with 2007's Tokyo Majin, co-animated by AIC Spirits and BeSTACK. He has stated that while at his time at the studio, AIC took care of its animators well so that they could live, and was occasionally treated by his seniors at the studio. He cites Ryuichi Makino as one of his mentors while at AIC. In 2011, he made his debut as an animation director in 2011, with AIC's adaptation of R-15 of the same name. In 2013, he made his character designer debut with Pupipo!, animated by AIC PLUS+. In 2014, he left AIC and became an animator at Shaft. As of December 2019, he has become freelance.",
