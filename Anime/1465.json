He became a composer in his later high school years, through the various efforts made by himself and his teacher.\n\nIn 1985, he won a prize at the Kanagawa Arts Festival choral composition competition, while in the late 1980s, after entering Tokyo University of the Arts, he studied contemporary music under Satou Shin and Aoshima Hiroshi. While still being a student, he received the New Artist Award from the Japan Contemporary Music Association. He later started working as an arranger after graduating from college.\n\nIn 1999, he participated in the music unit \"Smart Drug\" with Koizumi Hiroshi, who was responsible for doing the composition and playing the guitar, and Okamoto Sayori who would later rename to Hiyoko, who was responsible for doing the lyrics and vocals. He participated under the alias \"Taque,\" where he was responsible for the arrangement and playing the keyboard. They released three CDs from 1999 to 2002.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Konaka is a Japanese writer and scenarist best known for shows such as [Serial Experiments Lain](https://anilist.co/anime/339/), [Digimon Tamers](https://anilist.co/anime/874/) and [Texhnolyze](https://anilist.co/anime/26/). He is also known to be the creator of Ultraman Gaia, as cited by Tsuburaya Productions.\n\nKonaka's serious works generally have a dark, psychological tone. As a Cthulhu Mythos writer, he tends to add Lovecraftian elements to his works.\n\n\"Chiaki J. Konaka\" is a very unusual name, as Japanese names typically do not include middle names. Konaka states that the \"J.\" evokes the \"Christian\" name \"John\", due to him being born to parents who were members of the Anglican Church, but he does not identify as Christian. He began using the \"J.\" at the age of 12, when he began making 8 mm films; he patterned the style after Western names such as \"Charles M. Schulz\".\n\nHe has cited [Ghost Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/2596/) as his favorite screenwriting project.",
