          "description": "[Blog](https://ameblo.jp/shinshungicu/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uchidashungicu)\n\nShungiku Uchida was born on August 7th, 1959, in Nagasaki prefecture. In 1984, she debuted with \"Coelacanth Burein,\" a mystery novel published by Futabasha. Writing about people's mentality from an original perspective, she has produced a lot of shocking stories. Her other activities include writing novels and acting.\n\nHer father left the family when she and her younger sister were in primary school. Her mother was a dance teacher and bar hostess, who soon began living with another dance instructor, and later remarried. Shungiku was often forced to sleep with her stepfather, and her mother would allow it. One of Shungiku's happiest memories from her childhood was getting a ream of rough paper from her fourth grade teacher, as a gift for saying that her dream was to become a manga artist.\n\nShungiku dropped out of high school in her second year and worked in restaurants, bars, in a printshop, and as a domestic. Sometimes she slept under bridges. Five years later she left Nagasaki for Tokyo with her beloved manga and $7,000 in savings. She graduated from Nagasaki Prefectural Nagasaki Minami High School. She then attended Keio University, majoring in philosophy in the Department of Literature, but left before completing a degree. Uchida is currently represented by the talent management firm Knockout.\n\nHer representative works include Wakaokusama Tamajigoku and Minami-kun no Koibito (which was later adapted into three drama series). Uchida is also known as \"Denko-chan\", the mascot character for The Tokyo Electric Power Company.\nBesides a career as a manga artist, she is also active with music and as a novelist. She wrote a controversial semi-autobiographical book called \"Fatherfucker\" which was also made into a live-action movie.",

After working for two years to save money for school, he entered Tokyo Designer Gakuin, a vocational school in Tokyo. He worked part-time in a gas station while attending the school. In 1979, he saw a [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/) recruitment advert in a magazine. He then applied to the studio, got hired, and subsequently dropped out of the vocational school.\n\nIn 1982, together with six colleagues, he established his own animation sub-contracting studio by the name Animaru Ya. By the mid '80s, Kigami had made a name for himself in the industry and was getting job offers straight to his name, which led him to working on film such as [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and [Grave of the Fireflies](https://anilist.co/anime/578/). In 1990, Kigami left Animaru Ya to take care of his mother in his hometown for a year.\n\nAfter his return to work he joined Kyoto Animation, and became a key factor in the to-be acclaimed animation studio's rapid growth throughout the years. Kigami mainly served as an animator during his career, but also directed, storyboarded and screenwrote numerous episodes and works for the studio. He was also involved in training young animators at the studio's training school.\n\nOn July 18, 2019, Kigami was tragically killed alongside 34 of his colleagues in the Kyoto Animation arson attack.",

After working for two years to save money for school, he entered Tokyo Designer Gakuin, a vocational school in Tokyo. He worked part-time in a gas station while attending the school. In 1979, he saw a [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/) recruitment advert in a magazine. He then applied to the studio, got hired, and subsequently dropped out of the vocational school.\n\nIn 1982, together with six colleagues, he established his own animation sub-contracting studio by the name Animaru Ya. By the mid '80s, Kigami had made a name for himself in the industry and was getting job offers straight to his name, which led him to working on film such as [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and [Grave of the Fireflies](https://anilist.co/anime/578/). In 1990, Kigami left Animaru Ya to take care of his mother in his hometown for a year.\n\nAfter his return to work he joined Kyoto Animation, and became a key factor in the to-be acclaimed animation studio's rapid growth throughout the years. Kigami mainly served as an animator during his career, but also directed, storyboarded and screenwrote numerous episodes and works for the studio. He was also involved in training young animators at the studio's training school.\n\nOn July 18, 2019, Kigami was tragically killed alongside 34 of his colleagues in the Kyoto Animation arson attack.",

At that time she credited herself with her real name but switched to the current variant shortly after.\n\nMost of her work revolves around shoujo shows, such as Mahou Tsukai Sally and Kodocha. Her debut as series composer was on the second season of Shounen Ashibe in 1992. She often works together with other female Writers Guild members, such as Reiko Yoshida and Mamiko Ikeda.",
