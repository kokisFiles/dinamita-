          "description": "Shouji Kawamori is an anime creator, director and mechanical designer. Also a current advisor for [Satelight](https://anilist.co/studio/41/).\n\nFamous for his work in the [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) and Transformers franchises. He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",

He made his initial splash in [Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket](https://anilist.co/anime/82/), and continued to develop his approach to animation which he calls \"full limited,\" which eliminated the pose-to-pose feel of conventional keyframe animation. His characteristic animation can be seen in [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) and [End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/).\n\nIn [Blood: The Last Vampire](https://anilist.co/anime/405/), Iso experimented with digital processing of his hand-drawn fire effects, elevating it to uncanny realism. Iso then got his first taste of directing in [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/) episode 15, which he largely animated and also digitally processed himself.\n\nHis animation sensibilities, process innovations, experience in multiple levels of anime production, and interest in technology culminated in the 2007 sci-fi series, [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/), his veritable brainchild. During its production, there was a rumored falling-out with key staff. For the next several years, Iso would quietly animate under the pseudonym Mikio Odagawa.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2018, he announced his retirement as an animator to focus exclusively on directing.",

After Bevore's dissolution, he joined Atelier Giga, and from there he joined Project Team Muu. There he was jointly in charge of the character designs, animation direction and storyboards for [Giant Robo the Animation: The Day the Earth Stood Still](https://anilist.co/anime/2321/). The production took nearly 10 years, during which Yamashita gave it his all. After the production was over he started losing his motivation for animation. Though, it sparked again, after having met [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on the opening animation for a video game called, Gensou Suikogaiden. \n\nIn 2001, Yamashita worked as a key animator on [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/), a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) feature film. There he was in charge of multiple scenes, most notably Chihiro and Haru's free fall at the end of the movie. This earned him high high praise from [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), and he was thus selected as one of the animation director's for [How's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/). Since then he has served as an animation director on most of Ghibli's movies.\n\nIn 2018, Yamashita directed \"The Invisible Man,\" a short film part of the anthology collection [Modest Heroes](https://anilist.co/anime/103887/), produced by [Studio Ponoc](https://anilist.co/studio/6147/). The film won the Newcomer's Award in the Animation Division at the 22nd Japan Media Arts Festival\n\nMarried to [Miho Shimogasa](https://anilist.co/staff/116279/).",

The same year he made his long-awaited debut in a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) film, working as a key animator on [Tales from Earthsea](https://anilist.co/anime/1829/) and then again on [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/). His work received high praise by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) for expressing the characters' individuality through their movements.\n\nNicknamed as \"Master\" (師匠, Shishou), by [Takahiro Kishida](https://anilist.co/staff/101403/) during the production of [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/).

This precept is still respected today and it's one of the reasons Japanese animation is so distinctly unique. His career is also a testament to his ethos that expressive and vibrant animation is not achieved simply through increasing the number of frames but through playing with movement, poses and timing.\n\nIn the early '00s, Kanada became an employee at Square Enix.\n\nNotable Square Enix titles in which he was credited:\n\n~!\n- 2002, Final Fantasy XI (Motion Capture, Animation Director)\n- 2005, Musashiden II: Blade Master (Storyboard)\n- 2006, Dawn of Mana (Facial Setting)\n- 2007, Final Fantasy 4 DS Version (Storyboard)\n- 2009, Final Fantasy XIII (Storyboard Director) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2011, Final Fantasy XIII-2 (Storyboard) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2012, Dragon Quest X (Storyboard)  - *Posthumous credit.* !~",
