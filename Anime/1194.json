          "description": "**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/cunepero)**\n\nKojima got started in the industry one day while he was working as a freelancer in various industries and somehow ended up with a job in anime at the age of 23.\n\nHis first project was on the show \"[Shima Shima Tora no Shimajirou](https://anilist.co/anime/9768/Shima-Shima-Tora-no-Shimajirou/)\" under [Studio Kikan](https://anilist.co/studio/256/Studio-Kikan), where he got started of by doing in-between animation. At the time he was very unexperienced with anime production and has [said](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he likely would have been fired for his lack of knowledge and poor quality work, if not for the in-between animation checker teaching him everything from scratch.\n\nLater down the line after establishing himself more in the anime industry, he would go on to work on \"[Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/Tengen-Toppa-Gurren-Lagann/)\" as a challenge to himself, where he would put forth mecha and effects animation he had no idea how to prior.\n\nKojima [states](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he feels a lot of inspiration from manga artists who are able to think about a story, break it up into panels, and express it in pictures. He has thought about drawing a manga himself, even if it's something simple.\n\nSome of his favorite anime are \"[Inital D](https://anilist.co/anime/185/Initial-D/),\" \"[Natsume's Book of Friends](https://anilist.co/anime/4081/Natsume-Yuujinchou/),\" \"[Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-](https://anilist.co/anime/21355/ReZero-kara-Hajimeru-Isekai-Seikatsu/),\" \"[Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Shin-Seiki-Evangelion/),\" \"[A KITE](https://anilist.co/anime/320/A-KITE/),\" \"[JIN-ROH](https://anilist.co/anime/570/JINROH/),\" \"[FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/)\" and \"[Doukyuusei -Classmates-](https://anilist.co/anime/21096/Doukyuusei/).\"\n\nSome of his favorite manga are \"[HI Score Girl](https://anilist.co/manga/74501/Hi-Score-Girl/)\" and \"[A White Rose in Bloom](https://anilist.co/manga/108360/Mejirobana-no-Saku/).\"\n",

          "description": "John Ledford is an entrepreneur and leader in the North American anime industry. In 1992, he founded A.D. Vision (ADV), paving the way for other businesses and the exponential growth anime has had within North America. With ADV's success, Ledford turned his sights to making the imaginative world of anime even more accessible with Anime Network's founding, North America’s first cable TV network dedicated to anime. He later partnered with Kadokawa Publishing and began Newtype USA with translated Japanese content and exclusive U.S. material related to all things anime, manga, and model reviews. This endeavor expanded into ADV Manga, which obtained licensing and publishing rights for hundreds of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.\n\nIn 2008, Ledford founded a new anime-focused company called Sentai Filmworks (Sentai). Since its founding, Sentai provides thousands of hours of content across traditional and digital platforms. Sentai’s dedication to bringing captivating stories, including acclaimed titles such as Grave of the Fireflies, Ninja Scroll, and High School of the Dead to audiences, is ongoing.\n\nLedford’s most recent success is with the 2017 founding of the streaming service HIDIVE. Since launching, HIDIVE is now available via a web browser, mobile devices, gaming platforms, and more. HIDIVE offers new simulcasts every season, an ever-growing collection of dubs, and exclusive titles. The service features DUBCAST SM editions, early access local-language dubs of simulcasts directly produced by HIDIVE, as early as two weeks after the original Japanese broadcast.\n\nFor nearly thirty years now, Ledford continues his goal to further the expansion of anime and the Japanese culture as a whole.",

He has been affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/) since its establishment.\n\nBorn in Tokyo and raised in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, he discovered his passion for anime during middle school, inspired by classics like [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/Galaxy-Express-999/) and [Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/).
