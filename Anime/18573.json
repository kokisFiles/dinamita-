          "description": "After graduating from Miyakojima Technical Senior High School, Kanbe moved to Tokyo and went to a Professional Training College while delivering newspapers to maintain himself. He joined Studio [Topcraft](https://anilist.co/studio/363/Topcraft) and as his first job he worked as production assistant on [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/).\n\nIn the late '80s and early '90s he worked on several NHK educational anime for children while he had his debut as director with the OVA [Ninja Ryuukenden](https://anilist.co/anime/619/Ninja-Ryuukenden/) in 1991. \n\nIn 1997 he established Studio Garan with several employees of [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/Studio-Junio) (which he had previously joined). Garan was one of the subcontracting studios for [Cardcaptor Sakura](https://anilist.co/anime/232/Cardcaptor-Sakura/) and the episodes Kanbe directed garnered much attention. He left Garan in 2000.\n\nMore recently he's been mainly known for directing psychological and thriller anime like [Elfen Lied](https://anilist.co/anime/226/Elfen-Lied/), [Electromagnetic Girlfriend](https://anilist.co/anime/5177/Electromagnetic-Girlfriend/) and [The Promised Neverland](https://anilist.co/anime/101759/The-Promised-Neverland/).",
