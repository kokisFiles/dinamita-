  "description": "In Route 20 people live in a metal city surrounded by a glass dome, that protects its inhabitants from the polluted air of the outside, and controlled by a paranoic and oppressive police state. They feel free and sure, albeit they are like imprisoned. But some \"rebel\" boys have different feelings. Ushiji is one of them, a boy that follows his dream... or, better, rides his dream: his motorcycle and its metaphoric meaning of freedom, with the memories of his grandfather's tales about the absence of rules and hypocrisies of the outer world.\n<br><br>\n<i>Note: This manga ran for 5 issues in Newtype Magazine and never received a tankoubon release.</i>",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/y_sadamoto)\n\nYoshiyuki Sadamoto is an animator, illustrator, character designer, and one of the founding members of studio Gainax.\n\nAfter college, Sadamoto learned the ropes of key animation under [Yasuo Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/Yasuo--Otsuka) at Telecom before becoming a founding member of Gainax. Otsuka later named Sadamoto one of the three men more skillful than him. Though Sadamoto is not an unskilled animator by any means, his reputation rests mainly on his iconic character designs, evident in the reception of the Evangelion cast. Nearly all of Gainax' biggest productions have their characters designed by Sadamoto. He is one of the biggest contributors to the general look of Gainax anime and has proven to be massively influential for character designers of future generations.\n\nSadamoto's characters are often thin, fragile and have sharp yet understated facial features. He pays a lot of attention to fashion as well.\n\nMost of Sadamoto's influences are mangaka such as [Katsuhiro Otomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Otomo), [Yoshitaka Amano](https://anilist.co/staff/97967/Yoshitaka-Amano), [Kazuo Umezu](https://anilist.co/staff/97777/Kazuo-Umezu), and [Leiji Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/97597/Leiji-Matsumoto). Sadamoto would go on to author the Evangelion manga. \n\nPost-Gainax he has remained active as character designer, mostly for [Mamoru Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/Mamoru-Hosoda)'s popular feature films. He has also focused on different visual and illustration works, as he worked on several manga and is co-creator and character designer for the .hack game franchise.",
