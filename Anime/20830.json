Though Sugahara later left the band, he would still be responsible for illustrating their mascot character [Tonio-chan](https://anilist.co/character/151384), as well as writing lyrics for one of their songs, *Heiwajima*, and working on several of their music videos and album jackets. He would still be credited as the band's \"Golden Member\" until the band's disbandment.\n\nIn 1999, at the age of 19, Sugahara made his debut as a manga artist. His CG-Manga [Minna no Tonio-chan](https://anilist.co/manga/110231), featuring B-DASH's mascot character, was serialized for two years in the weekly magazine *SPA!*.
