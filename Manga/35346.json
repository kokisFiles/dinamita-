  "description": "It was once a land in which the peace was protected by a king who ruled from the center of the empire. The singers who lived in the villages of the land supported the king with their song. However, they lived as if  in captivity and her destiny was to sing constantly. The strength of the singers has been transmitted only from mother to daughter. The singers were closed by order of the king in towers and should always sing lullabies.

When Kain finds out that the village uses the singers, he protects his sister Maria to preserve her from such a destiny...",

          "description": "__Tools:__ IllustStudio, Cintiq 13HD\n\n[Twitter](http://twitter.com/moyasshi) | [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/users/1101)\n\nHer older sister introduced her to manga by showing Aki the comics she drew and later buying her a Saint Seiya doujinshi. She became a mangaka mainly because of her father's and sister's influences, both of whom she said are fans of anime and manga. She grew up surrounded by anime such as Doraemon, which is largely due to her father's interest in anime.\n\nAfter being introduced to the Saint Seiya doujinshi, she became interested in doujinshi of other series, such as Gundam Wing. In 2000, she started up her own doujinshi circle, Shachou no Subako (a Gensou Suikoden centered circle (though, it recently began releasing doujinshi for other series as well, such as Tales of Zestiria and Road to Dragons). Later, in 2006, she published her first series, Utahime, in Libre Shuppan's Kurofune Zero.\n\nIn addition to being a mangaka, Aki also illustrates light novels.\n\n(Source: Aki's long interview in Haruca)\n\nShe owns a dog which she affectionately calls \"furball.\"",
