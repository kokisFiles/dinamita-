Eventually, a recording contract with Toshiba-EMI was signed and, under the stage name Cubic U, Utada released their English-language debut album Precious in early 1998, but it was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, their Japanese-language debut First Love was released and became an instant success. Backed by the massive success of singles \"Automatic,\" \"Time Will Tell,\" and \"Movin' On Without You,\" the album sold two million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the Oricon charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six million more throughout the rest of 1999. First Love eventually became the country's best-selling album of all time.\n\nBy the end of the '00s, Utada was deemed \"the most influential artist of the decade\" in the Japanese music landscape by The Japan Times. Utada's commercial success has made them one of Japan's top-selling recording artists of all time with over 37 million records sold since launching their career in the late '90s. Twelve of their singles have reached number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart, while ten of their albums have become chart-toppers. Six of their full-length releases are among the country's highest-selling albums of all time, including First Love, Distance and Deep River, which are among the top ten best-selling records of Japan's music history.\n\nUtada has performed theme songs for all of the four [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/2759/) reboot movies, as well as for [Freedom](https://anilist.co/anime/1747/) and [To Your Eternity](https://anilist.co/anime/114535/).\n\nAdditionally, they are also known by international audiences for writing and producing four theme-songs to the video game series Kingdom Hearts.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

After graduating from high school, he joined Studio Musashi, which was recruiting staff through newspaper ads. His first work as an official in-betweener was for [Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace](https://anilist.co/anime/1986/). He then moved to Studio Cockpit, where he worked on [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/), before moving on to NeoMedia. There he worked on [Trider G7](https://anilist.co/anime/4536/), [Doraemon](https://anilist.co/anime/2471/), and [Belle and Sebastian](https://anilist.co/anime/3836/). With Trider G7, he was promoted from in-between to key animation. He left NeoMedia in 1982 to work as a freelancer, starting with [Combat Mecha Xabungle](https://anilist.co/anime/2254/) and [Makyou Densetsu Acrobunch](https://anilist.co/anime/3880/).\n\nThe popular anime [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/), in which he participated from the same year, was Moriyama's breakthrough work. With this series, he made his debut as an animation director and storyboard artist, and was in charge of the opening animation for the first time, joining a group of popular animators overnight. Chief director [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/), who was responsible for Urusei Yatsura, expected him to become a partner, so Moriyama tried his hand at manga as well by illustrating a manga written by Oshii that was serialized in the Animage magazine in 1984 called Todo no Tsumari. After the end of Urusei Yatsura, he was selected as a character designer for the later series [Maison Ikkoku](https://anilist.co/anime/1453/), and has since been in charge of character design for many other works. In 1987, he won the 4th Japan Anime Awards in the Animation Director category. After that, he shifted from animating to directing.\nAfter that he participated in many works, mainly Chaos Project , Studio Pierrot , and Studio Hibari and then has seated at Studio Hibari's Lerche. \n\nMoriyama often works under one of his many pen-names.\n\n",

There he met noted animators [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/), the former which he would work with on numerous occasions afterwards.\n\nHis breakthrough as an animator was on [Noein](https://anilist.co/anime/584/), a series directed by [Kazuki Akane](https://anilist.co/staff/102416/). The 12th episode was highly regarded by animation fans and other animators for the given display by him and Matsumoto. He would later also serve as a character designer on [Birdy the Mighty: Decode](https://anilist.co/anime/3974/), another series directed by Akane.\n\nHis dedication for animation could also be seen on [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/), for which he animated a minute-long scene of the main character running down a street. He went on the actual street in Tokyo to film himself for reference footage for the cut.",

He later joined [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/), where he debuted as the studio's youngest animation director on [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). A few years later in 1994, he got to handle the character designs for the first time on [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/), a TV series directed by [Akiyuki Shinbou](https://anilist.co/staff/100089/).\n\nAfter having left Gainax, Honda participated in most of [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)'s works. Perhaps most notably as a character designer on [Millenium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), a role which was originally planned to be [Hideki Hamasu](https://anilist.co/staff/125820/)'s, but was given to him due to Hamasu having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. Honda also designed the characters for [Mitsuo Iso](https://anilist.co/staff/100151/)'s [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/).\n\nIn 2006, Honda joined [Studio Khara](https://anilist.co/studio/47/) and reprised his vital staff roles in the [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/2759/) franchise. The same year he made his long-awaited debut in a [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) film, working as a key animator on [Tales from Earthsea](https://anilist.co/anime/1829/) and then again on [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/). His work received high praise by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) for expressing the characters' individuality through their movements.\n\nNicknamed as \"Master\" (師匠, Shishou), by [Takahiro Kishida](https://anilist.co/staff/101403/) during the production of [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/).
