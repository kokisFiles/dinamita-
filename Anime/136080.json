          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gekidaninucurry) \n\nGekidan Inu Curry is an animation duo that consists of Ayumi Shiraishi and Yousuke Anai. **Shiraishi**, also known as 2White Dog (2白犬), graduated from Yoani and joined Studio Gainax in the early '00s. She worked on less celebrated franchises but by 2006-07 received many high profile requests and directorial opportunities in the industry due to the promise she showed. **Anai**, also known as Doroinu (泥犬), held a position as digital painter at subcontracting studio TANTO, struggling to find opportunities to advance his career. Anai would eventually turn back to his old colleague Shiraishi, as TANTO shut down in 2007, to pair up for Gekidan Inu Curry.\n\nGekidan Inu Curry broke through when voice actress [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/Maaya-Sakamoto) saw some of their drawings she fancied so much she requested a music video production. \n\nTheir trademark aesthetic had been on showcase since day one: cute fairy tale concepts that turn out to be more twisted on closer inspection, a combination of standard 2D animation using paper with all sorts of stop-motion techniques, and collages that similarly mix not just art styles but different materials together. The duo often chooses to have their work credited as a \"*(public) performance*\"; which elegantly summarizes the Gekidan Inu Curry experience. Their craft is very physical, going as far as to make [plushies](https://i.imgur.com/mnSI6We.jpg), making it feel as if you're watching an exhibition.\n\nGekidan Inu Curry strongly wear their influences on their sleeves, often citing a deep appreciation for Russian and Czech animation, with more emphasis on the latter. The influence of Czech puppet animation is very thick and reminiscent of filmmakers such as [Jiří Trnka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C5%99%C3%AD_Trnka) and [Jan Švankmajer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_%C5%A0vankmajer). Observing their works more closely we can see parallels, such as grotesque, unsettling takes on fairy tale concepts without compromising the childlike wonder they're supposed to evoke.\n\nAlthough Gekidan Inu Curry have worked for many studios, such as Gainax and Production I.G., their most prominent works are on Studio SHAFT shows, with mega-hit [Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/Madoka-Magica/) propelling them into stardom. The duo was approached at an early stage of pre-production and given much freedom to create something genuinely otherworldly, which led to them leaving a strong impression. The multi-talented duo received the artistic freedom to handle all of the backstories for the witches, allowing them to further expand the *Madoka* universe and inextricably tying themselves to the identity of the franchise, which eventually led to their work as chief director on the spin-off [Magia Record: Mahou Shoujo Madoka☆Magica Gaiden](https://anilist.co/anime/104051/Magia-Record-Mahou-Shoujo-MadokaMagica-Gaiden/)\n\n[source](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2019/09/16/gekidan-inu-curry/)\n",

He started at animation studio Vega Entertainment, and later joined Shaft. He is best known for directing Puella Magi Madoka Magica and its subsequent film trilogy alongside Akiyuki Shinbo, the latter trilogy which subsequently garnered ¥2 billion, making it a box-office success.\n\nMiyamoto described himself as being a \"heretic\" at Shaft-- someone who, in a company of many differing directors, is only good at doing \"plain work\", and isn't particularly original or creative. Shinbo described Miyamoto in a similar way, but said that he was more like a professional craftsman who leaves their mark in places that cannot be seen.",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/新房昭之) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Shinbo)\n\nAkiyuki Shinbou is a Japanese director, producer, animator and storyboard artist. He joined Studio One Pattern in 1981. He made his directorial debut with [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/) in 1994. He joined Shaft in 2004. He has received the 11th Tokyo Anime Award and the 2011 Newtype Anime Award for Best director for his work on the acclaimed anime series [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/).\n\nShinbou was born in Fukushima Prefecture. After high school, he attended Tokyo Designer Institute before entering the anime industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo Design Institute, Shinbou worked as an animator for the 1981 anime series [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/). Shinbou participated with Studio Pierrot in 1990 as an episode director in [Musashi](https://anilist.co/anime/8065/). His first full directorial debut was however the previously mentioned, with Metal Fighter Miku. He continued his early directional career with several OVA series in the late 90's. Shinbou participated with Seven Arcs starting with [Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever](https://anilist.co/anime/176/) in 2003 and then became director for 2004's spin-off [Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha](https://anilist.co/anime/76/).\n\nHis style in particular became noticed during his episode direction work on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/)'s Dark Tournament arc. After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies. In an interview, Kubota cited [Le Portrait de Petit Cossette](https://anilist.co/anime/514/) and [The SoulTaker](https://anilist.co/anime/1048/) among Shinbou's most distinctive products that caught his eye.\n\nHis work at Shaft has been characterized by extensive experimentation within the visual medium of animation, and often includes pictures taken from real life cut into scenes, as well as art shifts, beat panels, kabuki sound effects, textures that remain stationary when the textured object moves, showing symbols or defining parts of a character in place of characters during dialogue, written text in place (in opposition to dialogue), precise use of fan service, and \"head-tilting\", a style known as a Shaft specialty.\n\nHe says that the reason he sticks with Shaft is due to their system and professional capacity, which make his expression of direction much easier. The so-called \"Team Shinbou\" includes himself, [Tatsuya Oishi](https://anilist.co/staff/103552/) and [Shin Oonuma](https://anilist.co/staff/101753/).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

They have since changed their name to “ClariS” for their major debut in 2010, which means “sunny, clean and bright” in Latin. Since they were still high school students and wanted to focus on their school studies, they would not reveal their identities. Therefore, they would only be shown as illustrations. They both started their high school education in April 2012, according to their official Twitter.  When drawn, Clara is depicted wearing pink items, and Alice is shown wearing blue items. Images of the crescent moon are used as a motif to represent Clara, and the sun is used to represent Alice, which comes from their personal preferences. Clara is shown with slightly wavy hair and no bangs, while Alice is drawn with straight hair with bangs.\n\nIn 2014, Alice left ClariS to focus on her studies. Clara was then joined by her friend Karen whom she met when they were classmates at the same music school. When drawn, Karen is depicted wearing pastel green items, and images of stars are used to represent her.\n\nOn the 1st September 2024, ClariS Karen announced her graduation after ClariS AUTUMN TOUR 2024.\n\n__Members:__\n- Clara (クララ) (2009-)\n- Ellie (エリー) (2025-)\n- Anna (アンナ) (2025-)\n\n__Former Members:__\n- Alice (アリス) (2009-2014)\n- Karen (カレン) (2014-2024)",
