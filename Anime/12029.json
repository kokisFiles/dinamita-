  "description": "The year is 2199. The human race has been crushed in their war with the Gamilos, driven into underground cities by the invader's assault. Scientists estimate they have only a year left. The young officers Susumu Kodai and Daisuke Shima receive a mysterious capsule from a ship that made an emergency landing on Mars and return with it to Earth. It contains humanity's last hope: the planet Iscandar on the other side of the Magellan Galaxy has the technology to defeat the Gamilos and restore the planet. The space battleship Yamato is entrusted with this task, but they have only one year before humanity ends.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

She was also the winner of the \"Best Musical Performance\" award in the first Seiyuu Awards. She was also part of the quartet Prits alongside Yumiko Kobayashi, Natsuko Kuwatani, and Hisayo Mochizuki (all four voiced characters in the anime _Sister Princess_).

His career began in 1978, debuting as a mechanical designer on [Toushou Daimos](https://anilist.co/anime/2816/), designing the enemy robots. Few years later in 1981, he made his tokusatsu debut on Robot 8-chan.\n\nThe following decade he worked on industry shaping series such as [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/86/), [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/) and [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/). During this time he also had ties to Parallel Creation, a creative group led by sci-fi writer [Aritsune Toyota](https://anilist.co/staff/220367/). This led him to work as an illustrator on novels such as [Record of Lodoss War](https://anilist.co/manga/92655/), in which his designs were deeply influential for Japanese fantasy series.\n\nIn 2002, he directed [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), an anime original created by him. Izubuchi said that his attempt was to set a new standard for mecha anime, as well as to bring back aspects of '70s mecha shows like [Brave Raideen](https://anilist.co/anime/2128/).\n\nA trademark in his mechanical designs is the Buchi-hole (ブチ穴), a series of round holes embedded, usually in a cluster pattern of three holes above and two below, located somewhere on the mecha.",

About a year after they formed, Osada would formally leave the unit in 2003, which is also when they disbanded as a two-piece unit. \n\nRino decided to reform the music unit as a solo unit after Osada's departure, and has since been the sole member, who now performs the vocals, while also doing most of the lyrics and composition in the songs. When it comes to the arrangement, the unit largely collaborates with other creators, most prominently [Kaoru Ookubo](https://anilist.co/staff/150930/Kaoru-Ookubo), who has made the arrangement for 19 of CooRie's songs between 2005 and 2015.\n\n__Members:__\n- [Rino](https://anilist.co/staff/96532) (りの) – vocalist and in-charge of lyrics and composition\n\n__Former Members:__\n- Naoyuki Osada (長田直之) – keyboardist and in-charge of composition and arrangement",

The band's name \"Uverworld\" is a term coined by the band members, which they did by combining the German word \"über\" (meaning over) with the English word \"world\"  to form a phrase that means \"crossing above the world\".\n\nAs a band they have released a total of nine studio albums and over twenty singles, which all garnered quite the success. They have also sold over three million records worldwide. The band is influenced by 1960s rock bands like The Beatles, The Zombies and The Beach Boys. The style became so popular it was later influenced by The Cookies, The Kinks and The Cramps. Vocalist Takuya Shimizu later cited Frank Sinatra, Queen, David Bowie, Weezer, Green Day and My Chemical Romance as the influencers for the band.\n\n__Biography:__\nThe six-piece band known as UVERworld first formed back in 2000, and were at the time known as Sound Goku Road, (or alternatively more popularily known as \"Sangoku Road\" in the independent music scene). The band originally consisted of seven members, and at the time released a demo CD titled Prime'03. This CD ended up selling 3000 copies, and as an unfortunate follow-up to the CD, two of the band members ultimately decided to leave. The members who left were their saxophonist Seika, and their second-man vocalist Ryohei. After Seika's departure their vocalist Ace∞trigger renamed himself to TAKUYA∞, while the band also renamed to UVERworld.\n\nIn 2005, the band signed with record label gr8! records. The band made their debut with the single titled \"D-technolife\", which was used as the second opening theme to the now famous anime Bleach. The single made its debut in the Oricon charts at the fourth spot, with a total of 32.000 copies sold. The single landed close to Mr. Children's twenty-seventh single \"Yonjigen Four Dimensions\", which took the very top spot. The single would later drop to seventh place a week later, with a toal of 16,306 copies sold. The third week the single would see another drop from seventh to ninth spot, with a total of 13,761 copies sold. Later it was revealed that the single lasted five weeks in the Top 30 weekly singles rankings. The single's sales and Chaku-Uta Full downloads were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.\n\nThree months later, their second single \"Chance!\" was used as the commercial and opening theme song to the second PSP game of Bleach: Heat the Soul series. The band's second single first entered the Oricon charts on the fifth spot, with a total of 14,150 copies sold. The single later dropped to the 23rd spot, with a total of 6,360 copies sold in the second week. The single's ranking remained the same, however the number of copies sold by the third week was fewer than the previous week with a total of 5,495 copies sold. It was later revealed that the single only managed to stay on the Top 30 weekly singles ranking for three weeks.\n\n<i>(Continuation of their biography on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uverworld#2006%E2%80%932008:_Timeless,_Bugright_and_Proglution))</i>\n\n__Members:__\n- [Takuya Shimizu](https://anilist.co/staff/101650/) (清水琢也), also known as TAKUYA∞ - vocalist, rapper, guitarist, bassist, pianist, synthesizer, programmer, drummer and in-charge of lyrics and composition (2000-)\n- Katsuya (克哉) - guitarist, keyboardist, programmer and percussionist (2000-)\n- Nobuto (信人) - bassist and percussionist (2000-)\n- Seika (誠果) - saxophonist, percussonist, manipulator and recorder (2000-)\n- [Akira](https://anilist.co/staff/296788) (彰) - guitarist, programmer, percussionist and in-charge of composition (2000-)\n- Shintaro (真太郎) - drummer and percussionist (2000-)\n\n(Source: [Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/UVERworld), edited)",

He was born in 1934 and graduated from Nihon University Art Department.\n\nIn 1994 he designed Yamato 2520. But in the end he was sued by Matsumoto Leiji for breach of copyright. Since then he has been arrested for gun and drug offences. Later in 2002 the court ruled that Nishizaki was the original author and owner of the copyright for Uchuu Senkan Yamato. Matsumoto appealed but settled out of court in 2003 in agreement that Nishizaki was the author.\n\nHe passed away on November 7th, 2010 at the age of 75 when he fell from a research steamboat, named Yamato, to the sea near Chichijima island and drowned.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
