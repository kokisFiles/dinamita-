  "description": "Yuko Kusaka is a Japanese journalist sent to Brazil to do a report on the gold rush phenomenon that seems to be making many people rich from night to day.<br><br>\nRumors say that among the many \"garimpeiros\" (gold diggers) currently on the Amazon forest, there is a Japanese known as Rio Baraki. Reaching their destination, her crew member is promptly attacked and she is raped as a warning to stop their work and return immediately to their home country. Determined to do her job, she stays and finds out from the attacker that he is none other than Baraki, a white haired muscular man with a large scar on his back. Later she discovers that his real name is Keisuke Ibaraki. Once a promising quarterback, he ended up falsely incriminated by a powerful organization known as GPX.\n",

Despite his age, his first two collaborative efforts (1973's <i>AIUEO Boy</i> with Kazuo Koike and 1974's <i>Otoko Gumi</i> with Tetsu Kariya) proved so popular they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators.\n",

          "description": "__Height__: 183 cm\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kazuo_Koike/)\n\nKoike was a prolific Japanese manga writer, novelist and entrepreneur. \n\nEarly in Koike's career, he studied under *Golgo 13* creator [Takao Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/97907/Takao-Saitou) and served as a writer on the series. \n\nKoike, along with artist Goseki Kojima, made the manga [Kozure Ookami](https://anilist.co/manga/30904/Kozure-Ookami/), and Koike also contributed to the scripts for the 1970s film adaptations of the series, which starred famous Japanese actor Tomisaburo Wakayama. Koike and Kojima became known as the \"Golden Duo\" because of the success of Kozure Ookami.  Another series written by Koike, [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/manga/31449/Crying-Freeman/), which was illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, was adapted into a 1995 live-action film by French director Christophe Gans.  Kazuo Koike started the Gekika Sonjuku, a college course meant to teach people how to be mangaka.\n\nIn addition to his more violent, action-oriented manga, Koike, an avid golfer, has also written golf manga.",
