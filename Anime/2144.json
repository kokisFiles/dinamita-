  "description": "Led by Kakashi Hatake, Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, and Rock Lee are tasked to escort the extravagant Prince Michiru Tsuki and his spoiled son Hikaru to the prosperous Land of Moon when the two return from a long trip around the world. As if guarding two whimsical high-ranked individuals was not challenging enough, the prince's reckless decision to acquire an entire circus during their journey—mainly to entertain Hikaru's wish of owning the saber-toothed tiger featured in the show—further propels the mission into disarray.<br>\n<br>\nJust as things are finally settling down, the arrival of Michiru's convoy at the Land of Moon is met with an unforeseen crisis—the greedy Chief Minister Shabadaba has taken over the country with the assistance of mysterious, powerful ninjas. While Kakashi's team relentlessly fights the enemy by any means necessary, the two princes are forced to confront a new outlook on life through adversity.<br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

He initially failed an examination test for [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/) but was later scouted by the late [Osamu Kobayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/100406/) for [Beck](https://anilist.co/anime/57/). There he met noted animators [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/), the former which he would work with on numerous occasions afterwards.\n\nHis breakthrough as an animator was on [Noein](https://anilist.co/anime/584/), a series directed by [Kazuki Akane](https://anilist.co/staff/102416/). The 12th episode was highly regarded by animation fans and other animators for the given display by him and Matsumoto. He would later also serve as a character designer on [Birdy the Mighty: Decode](https://anilist.co/anime/3974/), another series directed by Akane.\n\nHis dedication for animation could also be seen on [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/), for which he animated a minute-long scene of the main character running down a street. He went on the actual street in Tokyo to film himself for reference footage for the cut.",
