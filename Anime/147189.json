          "description": "Tm Network (stylized TM NETWORK) was a Japanese pop/rock band. It consisted of Tetsuya Komuro (Keyboardist), Takashi Utsunomiya (Vocalist) and Naoto Kine (Guitarist).  They were original members of a band call Speedway during their school days. The three of them formed TM NETWORK. Their name is commonly thought to stand for “Time Machine Network”. However, on September 6th 2006 on an episode of Trivia no Izumi claimed that TM actually stands for \"Tama\", the district from Tokyo they all came from. While Trivia no Izumi claims that TM stands for \"Tama\" Tetsuya Komuro himself as early as 1984 on the show LiveG, has said that the TM stands for Time Machine.  They changed their name to TMN in 1990, and broke up in 1994. They had reunited under their old name of TM NETWORK in 1999.  Members: Tetsuya Komuro (小室哲哉) born November 27, 1958 in Fuchu, Tokyo - keyboard, composition, arrangement, lyrics, producer, chorus Takashi Utsunomiya (宇都宮隆) born October 25, 1957 - main vocals, chorus Naoto Kine (木根尚登) born September 26, 1957 - guitar, composition, piano, harmonica, chorus",

He quit music school as an elementary school student and, until his high school years, studied under Iwashita Tetsuya, who taught him how to use multiple recordings and synthesizers. He became a composer in his later high school years, through the various efforts made by himself and his teacher.\n\nIn 1985, he won a prize at the Kanagawa Arts Festival choral composition competition, while in the late 1980s, after entering Tokyo University of the Arts, he studied contemporary music under Satou Shin and Aoshima Hiroshi. While still being a student, he received the New Artist Award from the Japan Contemporary Music Association. He later started working as an arranger after graduating from college.\n\nIn 1999, he participated in the music unit \"Smart Drug\" with Koizumi Hiroshi, who was responsible for doing the composition and playing the guitar, and Okamoto Sayori who would later rename to Hiyoko, who was responsible for doing the lyrics and vocals. He participated under the alias \"Taque,\" where he was responsible for the arrangement and playing the keyboard. They released three CDs from 1999 to 2002.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is recognized as being the most successful producer in Japanese music history and introduced dance music to the Japanese mainstream. He was also a former owner of the discothèque Velfarre located in Roppongi, Tokyo.    He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in pop throughout the 1990s.    In the Oricon singles chart of April 15, 1996, he monopolized all the Top 5 positions as the songwriter and producer, a world record. In 1995 he monopolized all Top 3 positions of the copyright distribution rankings for the JASRAC Award, a record in Japan's music history.    At his peak as a record producer the artists he predominantly produced for came to be known as TK Family and at one time included Namie Amuro, hitomi, TRF, Tomomi Kahala and Ami Suzuki amongst others.    To date, singles composed by him have sold more than 70 million, singles whose lyrics he wrote have sold more than 42 million, and all in all records produced by him have sold more than 170 million in Japan alone.",
