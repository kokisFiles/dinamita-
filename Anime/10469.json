Matsuki was a graduate of Hiroshima Jogakuin Junior & Senior High School and Keio University where she majored from the Faculty of Environment and Information Studies. \n\nHer parents were officially against her becoming a voice actress but permitted her to move to Tokyo and visit the Keio University after she passed an entrance exam for it. After graduating from university she started pursuing her voice acting career and went at the same time to the Nichinare narration school and the Aksent voice acting school, where she later signed under after becoming professional.\n\nShe made her debut under her real name, Matsuki Mieko (松木美愛子) in 1988 on Nude Maker's PlayStation game Mikagura Shoujo Tanteidan. But changed shortly after to using a pseudonym instead as to protect her name.\n\nIn 2000 she passed an audition and became a member of newly established pop act Up Up under the Akatsuki Project label. In 2002 she got her first major role in an anime tv series, Shichinin no Nana. During the same year, in June, she quit Aksent and signed with talent agency 81 Produce. She became a regular on two radio shows, Sakurai Koubou and Cherry Bell in October 2002. The following years saw her involved with the Da Capo franchise a visual novel, adapted into an anime, where she played one of the main characters, Sagisawa Yoriko.\n\nMatsuki had been under treatment for acute pneumonia since July 2015. She was diagnosed with a malignant lymphoma caused by the chronic active Epstein–Barr virus infection (CAEBV) and passed away on October 27th 2015. A posthumous charity event had its proceeds go to CAEBV research, which, along with the medical history of her rare case, has helped establish the disease's mechanism of infection and possible treatment.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/新房昭之) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Shinbo)\n\nAkiyuki Shinbou is a Japanese director, producer, animator and storyboard artist. He joined Studio One Pattern in 1981. He made his directorial debut with [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/) in 1994. He joined Shaft in 2004. He has received the 11th Tokyo Anime Award and the 2011 Newtype Anime Award for Best director for his work on the acclaimed anime series [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/).\n\nShinbou was born in Fukushima Prefecture. After high school, he attended Tokyo Designer Institute before entering the anime industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo Design Institute, Shinbou worked as an animator for the 1981 anime series [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/). Shinbou participated with Studio Pierrot in 1990 as an episode director in [Musashi](https://anilist.co/anime/8065/). His first full directorial debut was however the previously mentioned, with Metal Fighter Miku. He continued his early directional career with several OVA series in the late 90's. Shinbou participated with Seven Arcs starting with [Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever](https://anilist.co/anime/176/) in 2003 and then became director for 2004's spin-off [Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha](https://anilist.co/anime/76/).\n\nHis style in particular became noticed during his episode direction work on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/)'s Dark Tournament arc. After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies. In an interview, Kubota cited [Le Portrait de Petit Cossette](https://anilist.co/anime/514/) and [The SoulTaker](https://anilist.co/anime/1048/) among Shinbou's most distinctive products that caught his eye.\n\nHis work at Shaft has been characterized by extensive experimentation within the visual medium of animation, and often includes pictures taken from real life cut into scenes, as well as art shifts, beat panels, kabuki sound effects, textures that remain stationary when the textured object moves, showing symbols or defining parts of a character in place of characters during dialogue, written text in place (in opposition to dialogue), precise use of fan service, and \"head-tilting\", a style known as a Shaft specialty.\n\nHe says that the reason he sticks with Shaft is due to their system and professional capacity, which make his expression of direction much easier.

After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies.
