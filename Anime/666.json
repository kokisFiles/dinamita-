  "description": " Kujo Jotaro is a normal, popular Japanese high-schooler, until he thinks that he is possessed by a spirit, and locks himself in prison. After seeing his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, and fighting Joseph's friend Muhammad Abdul, Jotaro learns that the \"Spirit\" is actually Star Platinum, his Stand, or fighting energy given a semi-solid form. Later, his mother gains a Stand, and becomes sick. Jotaro learns that it is because the vampire Dio Brando has been revived 100 years after his defeat to Jonathan Joestar, Jotaro's great-great-grandfather. Jotaro decides to join Joseph and Abdul in a trip to Egypt to defeat Dio once and for all. <br>",

          "description": "Hirohiko Araki is a manga artist. He left school before graduation from Miyagi University of Education.  \n\nAraki is best known for his long-running series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, published in Weekly Shonen Jump starting in 1987. The story is full of references to Western music and Italy, both of which Araki is reportedly very fond. Many of Araki's creations have been translated and released in Europe but so far only JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and Baoh have been released in the United States. One popular theory is that Araki's frequent references to Western music may violate American copyright laws. Viz has eluded much of this problem in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by replacing some band references with album or song references, which do not appear to be as strictly guarded. Araki is a recipient of the Tezuka Award.   \n\n(Source: JoJo's Bizarre Encyclopedia)",

While still in college, he debuted as a mangaka with the short Toriko (1984), coming second in the 10th Annual Tetsuya Chiba Awards held by Young Magazine. After graduating, he created the manga Kaikisen (1990) and captured the attention of [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/), who hired Kon to work on his [World Apartment Horror](https://anilist.co/manga/49058/) manga.\n\nHe debuted in the anime industry with [Roujin Z](https://anilist.co/anime/2000/), a movie written by Ootomo who became a great influence on Kon's early career. In 1993, he worked with Mamoru Oshii on [Patlabor 2](https://anilist.co/anime/1096/) as a layout artist, and the two then collaborated on the [Seraphim 266613336 Wings](https://anilist.co/manga/52441/) manga.\n\nHe debuted as an episode director and scriptwriter on the 5th episode of [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/) followed by the short Magnetic Rose, in Ootomo's anthology [Memories](https://anilist.co/anime/1462/). He made his directorial debut with [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/) in 1997.\n\nKon's death by pancreatic cancer was reported on August 24, 2010, shortly before his 47th birthday. Before passing, he composed a final message that was posthumously uploaded to his blog by his family. His last film, [The Dream Machine](https://anilist.co/anime/6585/), remains incomplete.\n\nYounger brother of [Tsuyoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/361096).",

He made his initial splash in [Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket](https://anilist.co/anime/82/), and continued to develop his approach to animation which he calls \"full limited,\" which eliminated the pose-to-pose feel of conventional keyframe animation. His characteristic animation can be seen in [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) and [End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/).\n\nIn [Blood: The Last Vampire](https://anilist.co/anime/405/), Iso experimented with digital processing of his hand-drawn fire effects, elevating it to uncanny realism. Iso then got his first taste of directing in [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/) episode 15, which he largely animated and also digitally processed himself.\n\nHis animation sensibilities, process innovations, experience in multiple levels of anime production, and interest in technology culminated in the 2007 sci-fi series, [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/), his veritable brainchild. During its production, there was a rumored falling-out with key staff. For the next several years, Iso would quietly animate under the pseudonym Mikio Odagawa.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2018, he announced his retirement as an animator to focus exclusively on directing.",

In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",

Much like [Kouichi Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/121208/), he was heavily influenced by [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/) and the late '80s realism. Early in his career he was employed at Toei Animation, and was thus a recurring presence in the studio's OVA works such as [Xanadu](https://anilist.co/anime/5920/), [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/anime/1153/) and [Vampire Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/1765/). His rising prominence during the early '90s allowed him to participate on [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), and from thereon he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\nIn 1993, Hamasu animated the car chase on [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)’s episode of the [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/). The scene impressed Kon enough for Hamasu to end up as a character designer and animation director on [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/). He was also set to serve a similar role in [Millennium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), but was replaced in the role by [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/) due to having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. He appeared on all of Kon’s films, as well as [Paranoia Agent](https://anilist.co/anime/323/) until the director's passing.\n\nMore recently he has mostly worked on [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) and [Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/)'s films.",
