After entering high school, due to the uncertainty he felt towards the future, Miyano started attending singing and dance lessons he has been skipping until now. While taking music lessons, Miyano started to discover his music style through the encounter with music produced by singers like CHEMISTRY and EXILE. Miyano's first acting job was in 1992 in Tokusou Exceedraft, where he appeared in a flashback as a child in a yakuza member's past.\n\nIn 2001, he had his voice acting debut in a live action teen drama Caitlin's Way.\n\nIn 2002, he voiced Riku in the Japanese version for the video game Kingdom Hearts. Miyano also had his first anime voice acting role the same year, voicing Akira in [Shin Megami Tensei Devil Children: Light & Dark](https://anilist.co/anime/4068/). In 2003, he voiced [Kiba](https://anilist.co/character/241/), the main character in [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/). A few years later in 2006, he had what most would call his breakout role in [Death Note](https://anilist.co/anime/1535/) where he voiced the main character [Light Yagami](https://anilist.co/character/80/). For his role as Light, he was nominated for two awards at the first ever Seiyuu Awards in March 2007.\n\nOn May 28, 2007, on the King Records label, Miyano debuted as a singer with the single \"Kuon.\" The single debuted at number 47 on the Oricon charts and was used as the ending theme song for anime series [Koutetsu Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/2162/). On June 13, he released a collaboration single titled \"Fight,\" with fellow voice actress [Romi Park](https://anilist.co/staff/95082/). The duo's single debuted on the Oricon chart at number 73.\n\nIn 2008, at the second Seiyuu Awards, Miyano won \"Best Actor in a Leading Role\" for his roles [Setsuna F. Seiei](https://anilist.co/character/4234/) and [Rikuson Hakugen](https://anilist.co/character/2844/), from [Mobile Suit Gundam 00](https://anilist.co/anime/2581/) and [Koutetsu Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/2162/) respectively.

This brought Maeda enough recognition to get invited on the production of [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), and the subseqeunt late '80s [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) films. He also worked on [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s projects during this time.\n\nIn 1992, after having completely cut ties with Ghibli due to differences in working methods, Maeda founded Gonzo together with [Shinji Higuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/107646/), [Hiroshi Yamaguchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97308/) and [Shouji Murahama](https://anilist.co/staff/119708/), who were Gainax employees he had previously worked with on [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/) and [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). At Gonzo he debuted as a director in 1998 with [Blue Submarine No.6](https://anilist.co/anime/1051/).\n\nIn 2004, Maeda directed [Gankutsuou](https://anilist.co/anime/239/), an adaptation of an 1844 novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, by [Alexandre Dumas](https://anilist.co/staff/102535/). Initially Maeda wanted to adapt an Alfred Bester novel, The Stars My Destination, but was rejected by the novel's copyright holders after proposing the numerous changes he wanted to make to the original narrative. He then searched for another work he could adapt into a science fiction setting and ended up going with The Count of Monte Cristo. The series was praised by Western critics and received multiple international accolades.\n\nCalled one of the most imaginative visualists in anime by Helen McCarthy, a British anime reference book author.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nKnown to have been a close friend of [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s before his passing.",
