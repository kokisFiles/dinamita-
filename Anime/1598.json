Kageyama got his big break at age 16, as lead singer of the pop group LAZY. By the early '80s, the band split and Kageyama went solo. He found major success once he started to sing the theme songs of anime and tokusatsu shows. Becoming immensely popular soon after, Kageyama went on to be dubbed the \"Prince of Anime/Tokusatsu Songs\" and is a main fixture for shows to this day. He also got the nickname \"Mr. DBZ\" by fans of Dragon Ball Z as he did the most songs for that anime. He is an original member and the current leader of the popular vocal group JAM Project. Also, along with Masaaki Endoh, he hosts \"Anipara Ongakukan\", a TV show that aired at Kids Station. One of the few voice acting roles he performed was Zaruba of the tokusatsu series GARO.\n\n[Website](http://www.airblanca.com/)",

          "description": "John Ledford is an entrepreneur and leader in the North American anime industry. In 1992, he founded A.D. Vision (ADV), paving the way for other businesses and the exponential growth anime has had within North America. With ADV's success, Ledford turned his sights to making the imaginative world of anime even more accessible with Anime Network's founding, North America’s first cable TV network dedicated to anime. He later partnered with Kadokawa Publishing and began Newtype USA with translated Japanese content and exclusive U.S. material related to all things anime, manga, and model reviews. This endeavor expanded into ADV Manga, which obtained licensing and publishing rights for hundreds of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.\n\nIn 2008, Ledford founded a new anime-focused company called Sentai Filmworks (Sentai). Since its founding, Sentai provides thousands of hours of content across traditional and digital platforms. Sentai’s dedication to bringing captivating stories, including acclaimed titles such as Grave of the Fireflies, Ninja Scroll, and High School of the Dead to audiences, is ongoing.\n\nLedford’s most recent success is with the 2017 founding of the streaming service HIDIVE. Since launching, HIDIVE is now available via a web browser, mobile devices, gaming platforms, and more. HIDIVE offers new simulcasts every season, an ever-growing collection of dubs, and exclusive titles. The service features DUBCAST SM editions, early access local-language dubs of simulcasts directly produced by HIDIVE, as early as two weeks after the original Japanese broadcast.\n\nFor nearly thirty years now, Ledford continues his goal to further the expansion of anime and the Japanese culture as a whole.",

          "description": "Tatsuo Yoshida an anime pioneer who founded anime studio Tatsunoko Productions.\n\nBorn in 1932, Yoshida grew up in the hardship of war-torn Japan. A self-taught artist, his first job was as working for local newspapers in Kyoto. After finding success as a manga artist in Tokyo, including winning the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1972 for Minashigo Hutch, in 1962 he founded Tatsunoko with his two younger brothers, Kenji (who took over Tatsuo's position as producer after he died) and Toyoharu (a.k.a. Kuri Ippei). The studio's name has a double Japanese meaning of \"Tatsu's child\" and \"sea dragon\" which was the inspiration for its seahorse logo.\n\nUnderstanding the future of television, Yoshida made the jump from print to the screen and found modest success with the anime racing series Mach Go Go Go. Once adapted to the English language market, it would achieve Blockbuster status as Speed Racer around the world. Yoshida's magical talent for storytelling again found success with the action series Gatchaman (also known as Battle of the Planets) and Casshan (now remade as the live-action film Casshern).\n\nThough Yoshida Tatsuo's brilliant career was cut short by his untimely death from liver cancer in 1977, Tatsunoko Productions has continued to partner with top creators to create additional hit series such as Macross (Robotech), Mospeada, Generator Gawl, Time Bokan, and Karas.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
