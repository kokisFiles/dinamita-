She's also a certified junior and senior high school teacher.\n\nHirohashi was born in Niigata Prefecture, and her family's home was a Buddhist temple. Because of this, she attended Ryukoku University in Kyoto, a Buddhist university. In the middle of her first year, however, her parents told her that she could do what she liked, even if it wasn't related to Buddhism, so she sought out what she wanted to do. During her second year, she remembered a radio show she used to listen to in middle school and became interested in voice acting, so she started going to the Aoni Coaching School Osaka while attending university at the same time. The radio personality she had listened to in junior high school was a voice actor, which inspired her to become a voice actor herself.\n\nNon-anime roles:\n• Mast - Goddess of Victory: Nikke",

          "description": "John Ledford is an entrepreneur and leader in the North American anime industry. In 1992, he founded A.D. Vision (ADV), paving the way for other businesses and the exponential growth anime has had within North America. With ADV's success, Ledford turned his sights to making the imaginative world of anime even more accessible with Anime Network's founding, North America’s first cable TV network dedicated to anime. He later partnered with Kadokawa Publishing and began Newtype USA with translated Japanese content and exclusive U.S. material related to all things anime, manga, and model reviews. This endeavor expanded into ADV Manga, which obtained licensing and publishing rights for hundreds of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.\n\nIn 2008, Ledford founded a new anime-focused company called Sentai Filmworks (Sentai). Since its founding, Sentai provides thousands of hours of content across traditional and digital platforms. Sentai’s dedication to bringing captivating stories, including acclaimed titles such as Grave of the Fireflies, Ninja Scroll, and High School of the Dead to audiences, is ongoing.\n\nLedford’s most recent success is with the 2017 founding of the streaming service HIDIVE. Since launching, HIDIVE is now available via a web browser, mobile devices, gaming platforms, and more. HIDIVE offers new simulcasts every season, an ever-growing collection of dubs, and exclusive titles. The service features DUBCAST SM editions, early access local-language dubs of simulcasts directly produced by HIDIVE, as early as two weeks after the original Japanese broadcast.\n\nFor nearly thirty years now, Ledford continues his goal to further the expansion of anime and the Japanese culture as a whole.",
