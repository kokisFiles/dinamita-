  "description": "Nanami Takahashi welcomes the start of her high school life with great expectations of making as many friends as possible. There is much talk among the girls about a popular boy, Motoharu Yano, who has 2/3 of the girls in his middle school liking him. When Nanami asks Yuri Yamamoto, the girl sitting next to her, about Yano, the latter curtly replies that she dislikes him. Nanami is clueless of who Yano is until the day of the class nomination when she made a fool of herself by calling the name of her new friend wrongly. It turns out that she has actually met Yano along the corridors (unaware of his true identity) and he tricked her by providing a random name, resulting in the embarrassing incident in class. Nanami was initially mad at Yano but after a few encounters with him, she begins to find herself liking him. ",

Therefore, he is known as an animation director who can actually read musical scores and has made the best use of his previous experience for works such as [Macross: Do You Remember Love?](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/) and Legend of the Galactic Heroes. He entered Nihon University in the Department of Art and graduated in 1964. He joined Onishi Pro where he first worked as a key animator on subcontracted Astro Boy episodes.

In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",
