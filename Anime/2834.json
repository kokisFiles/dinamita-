Tomomi is a sports star and has a boyfriend called Noda. Mikage is the smartest student in the school and is in love with her senpai. He moved to London to study but they still kept in touch, that is until a selfish princess called Marie decides that he should come with her back to Diammas. Back in Japan the twins are having various problems of their own. But they soon realize that there is a link between Marie, an ancient legend and a girl they know called Emma.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Although Daichi was an aspiring stage photographer he instead joined animation photography company Tokyo Animation Film where he continued to work for 5 years, although he temporarily changed jobs and shot live-action karaoke videos instead. In 1991 he left his employer, worked at a game production for half a year, and returned to the animation industry where he would study under animation director [Tetsuo Yasumi](https://anilist.co/staff/111207/). Daichi would advance into episode direction and caught the eyes of [Tatsuo Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/100391/) and [Hiroaki Sakurai](https://anilist.co/staff/101153/) who were impressed with his work on [*Akazukin Chacha*](https://anilist.co/anime/103/Akazukin-Chacha).

During this time she met [Yuuji Nunokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/117781/), who then invited her to join the establishment of [Studio Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/) in 1978.\n\nAt Pierrot she worked as an in-betweener on [Nils no Fushigi no Tabi](https://anilist.co/anime/2151/), the studio’s first show. After this she went freelance and soon gave up on her talent as an animator and turned into directing. She asked for guidance from [Kouichi Mashimo](https://anilist.co/staff/100094/), and made her debut as one of the two episode directors on the 29th episode of [Gold Lightan](https://anilist.co/anime/7106/) in 1981.\n\nShe continued her work storyboarding and directing episodes on shows such as [Dash Kappei](https://anilist.co/anime/2748/), [Miyuki](https://anilist.co/anime/2231/) and [Glass no Kamen](https://anilist.co/anime/506/). After this she made her series director debut with [Touch](https://anilist.co/anime/1065/) in 1985, a role which she was hand-picked for by [Gisaburou Sugii](https://anilist.co/staff/103537/), who served as the show’s chief director. They both reprised their roles for [Hiatari Ryoukou!](https://anilist.co/anime/729/) which took over the TV slot for Touch. After this Tokita directed [Yawara!](https://anilist.co/anime/691/), instead this time without an overseeing director.\n\nAfter having directed several more titles in the ‘90s, she switched her focus entirely to scriptwriting. As a writer she most famously worked on shows like [Tsukihime](https://anilist.co/anime/169/) and [School Rumble](https://anilist.co/anime/24/) before leaving the industry in 2009.",

In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",
