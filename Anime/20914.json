  "description": "When Fujiko secures a file that documents the location of the fabled Columbus Egg– a mystical relic found by Christopher Columbus which can be harnessed to control the weather– she quickly recruits Lupin and the gang to track down the long-lost treasure. To prevent a sinister villain from finding the Egg, Fujiko memorizes the file and destroys it. Unfortunately, in the process, she contracts amnesia, changing her personality and wiping her memory of Lupin and his friends almost entirely. Can they restore Fujiko back to normal before the Egg falls into the hands of a madman?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",

          "description": "__[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nabeshin_afro)__\n\n__Shinichi Watanabe__ is a Japanese director, episode director and storyboard artist for anime, while also being a voice actor.\n\nShinichi is best known for his over-the-top adaption of Rikudo Koshi's [Excel Saga](https://anilist.co/anime/379/Heppoko-Jikken-Animation-Excel-Saga), in which he appears as the character Nabeshin. In addition to his appearance in Excel Saga and [Puni Puni Poemy](https://anilist.co/anime/564/Puni-PuniPoemii), his likeness has also appeared as NB in [Tenchi Muyo! GXP](https://anilist.co/anime/1133/Tenchi-Muyo-GXP), Inu-Afro in [Dotto Koni-Chan](https://anilist.co/anime/1684/Dotto-Konichan) and in small role in [Mahoromatic](https://anilist.co/anime/276/Mahoromatic). He also does an unmistakable cameo of Nabeshin, which can be seen in [Nurse Witch Komugi](https://anilist.co/anime/615/Nurse-Witch-Komugichan/), although Shinichi had nothing to do with that project. In addition he made an appearance in the show [EyeShield 21](https://anilist.co/anime/15/Eyeshield-21). More recently he made an appearance in episode 32 of [Hayate no Gotoku](https://anilist.co/anime/2026/Hayate-no-Gotoku).\n\nShinichi claims that the nickname Nabeshin (which is an obvious combination of \"nabe\" in Watanabe, and \"shin\" in Shinichi) came from God himself.\n\n<i>(Not to be confused with the director [Watanabe Shinichirou](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/Shinichirou-Watanabe), which is most known for directing Cowboy Bebop)</i>",

          "description": "Monkey Punch is the pen name of mangaka Kazuhiko Katou, creator of the successful Japanese manga series [Lupin III](https://anilist.co/manga/30438/), which is still being animated to this day.\n\nInfluenced by [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/)'s works, he began to draw and moved to Tokyo in 1957 after graduating from high school. From 1959, he wrote for a publishing company specializing in rental books under the pen name \"Kazuhiko Katou,\" while working on doujins with his younger brother, Teruhiko Katou, and another friend. After moving to Tokyo, he was influenced by the American parody magazine \"MAD,\" and his style changed to an American comic book style. This caught the attention of Fumito Shimizu, editor-in-chief of Futabasha, and in 1966 he made his full-fledged debut with Playboy Nyuumon under the pen name Eiji Muta. Under the name of \"Mania Group,\" it was made to look as if Senji Mashuu (摩周仙二) and Eiji Kirita (霧多永二) were participating, but in reality, Katou wrote the whole story by himself.\n\nIn 1966, under the orders of editor-in-chief Shimizu, he changed his pen name to Monkey Punch. Katou didn't like the name because it was given to a newcomer at random, and he planned to change it after about a year, but he couldn't change it because the work he published under this name the following year became a big hit.\n\nIn May 1967, he was selected to draw the cover art for \"Zengan Manga Story Action Tokushuu-gou,\" which was published mainly for newcomers to \"Manga Story,\" such as Baron Yoshimoto and Ken Tsukikage, and he continued to draw the cover art for \"Shuukan Manga Action,\" a weekly seinen manga magazine that was newly launched in August with Shimizu as editor-in-chief. He also began serializing Lupin III under the title with the notation \"Original by [Leblanc](https://anilist.co/staff/122907/).\" in the August 10 first issue of Manga Action.\n\nIn addition to Lupin III, he has also created works such as Fukushuu Daikou, [Cinderella Boy](https://anilist.co/manga/71117/), and [MUSASHI: Gundou](https://anilist.co/anime/1200/). In 1996, he took on the challenge of directing an animated film with [Lupin III: Dead or Alive](https://anilist.co/anime/1416/).\n\nHe passed away due to pneumonia on April 11, 2019.\n\n**Awards:**\n- Inkpot Award\n- Rome Comic Festival ROMICS Gold Award\n- AMD Award for Merit\n- Japan Cartoonists Association Award Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She recorded her first album in 1968, selling over 2 million copies, establishing the first Brazilian that produced the most albums in Japan, totaling 32, culminating in a consolidated career in Asian lands and soon after moved to Japan. a year later, she recorded her second album in the studio in Tokyo, the EMI. Sonia had the cooperation of renowned Japanese jazz musicians such as saxophonist Sadao Watanabe and the his quartet, Shunichi Makaino, Kunihiko Suzuki, Koichi Uzaki and Akio Miyazawa. His repertoire undoubtedly is dug in Bossa Nova and perhaps the softness of Sonia voice and some rhythmic similarities, melodic and harmonic.\n\n(Source: MAL, edited)",

          "description": "__[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nabeshin_afro)__\n\n__Shinichi Watanabe__ is a Japanese director, episode director and storyboard artist for anime, while also being a voice actor.\n\nShinichi is best known for his over-the-top adaption of Rikudo Koshi's [Excel Saga](https://anilist.co/anime/379/Heppoko-Jikken-Animation-Excel-Saga), in which he appears as the character Nabeshin. In addition to his appearance in Excel Saga and [Puni Puni Poemy](https://anilist.co/anime/564/Puni-PuniPoemii), his likeness has also appeared as NB in [Tenchi Muyo! GXP](https://anilist.co/anime/1133/Tenchi-Muyo-GXP), Inu-Afro in [Dotto Koni-Chan](https://anilist.co/anime/1684/Dotto-Konichan) and in small role in [Mahoromatic](https://anilist.co/anime/276/Mahoromatic). He also does an unmistakable cameo of Nabeshin, which can be seen in [Nurse Witch Komugi](https://anilist.co/anime/615/Nurse-Witch-Komugichan/), although Shinichi had nothing to do with that project. In addition he made an appearance in the show [EyeShield 21](https://anilist.co/anime/15/Eyeshield-21). More recently he made an appearance in episode 32 of [Hayate no Gotoku](https://anilist.co/anime/2026/Hayate-no-Gotoku).\n\nShinichi claims that the nickname Nabeshin (which is an obvious combination of \"nabe\" in Watanabe, and \"shin\" in Shinichi) came from God himself.\n\n<i>(Not to be confused with the director [Watanabe Shinichirou](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/Shinichirou-Watanabe), which is most known for directing Cowboy Bebop)</i>",
