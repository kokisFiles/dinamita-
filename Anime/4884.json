  "description": "Luke fon Fabre, the spoiled son of a noble from the kingdom of Kimlasca-Lavaldear, has been confined inside his father's mansion ever since he was kidnapped seven years ago by a rival country, the Malkuth Empire. Now Luke's memory of the life he led before is missing, and a strange voice, which only he can hear, has been calling out to him ever since. One day while training with his mentor, Van Grants, a strange woman called Tear breaks into the mansion with the sole intent of taking Van's life. During the struggle Luke is transported far from home, along with Tear, and now that Luke has finally gained the freedom he's been dreaming of, what awaits him in the outside world will shatter everything he's ever known about himself.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Since their formation back in 1994, they have released eight albums and twenty-three singles. Their releases through the time became quite popular in Japan, seeing as every release since their third single, \"Tentai Kansoku\", has managed to reach the top ten in the Oricon Weekly Charts. Their music has also been used in various video games and as theme thongs for movies, television shows and anime. The band's name has its initial meaning from 弱者の反撃 (which when translated means _counterattack of the weak_).\n\n__Biography:__\n\"Let's form a band and change the history of rock.\", suggested 14 years old Hideo Masu to classmate and friend Motoo Fujiwara during their 2nd year at West Usai Junior High in 1994. Along with the two other childhood friends, Hiroaki Masukawa (g) and Yoshifumi Naoi (ba), they saved up their money to buy instruments; Fujiwara even says he saved up his lunch money instead of using it to buy food. However, due to his strict parents, Fujiwara asked Masukawa if he could hide his guitar at his house instead of bringing it home.\n\nTheir first performance was in 1994, during their ninth grade cultural festival, where they would play a cover of The Beatles' version of \"Twist and Shout\". At first they just played covers like this, but later they began writing their own songs that were in English.\n\nIn 1996, their song \"Danny\" won a prize on 96TFM. They were only 17 years old at the time.
