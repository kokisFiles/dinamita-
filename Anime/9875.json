Married to [Momoko Kamiya](https://anilist.co/staff/250361).\n\nUpon enrolling at Osaka University of Arts, Yuuichi Terao, alongside [Takashi Suhara](https://anilist.co/staff/146678/Takashi-Suhara) and others, embarked on the autonomous creation of animated films, even organizing screenings through university circles in the Kanto region. After joining animation production company ufotable in December 2003, Terao, initially aspiring for the production department as a production manager but he was assigned to the newly formed photography department (now the Digital Imaging Department) due to presenting visual materials during his interview. Despite lacking prior photography expertise, he learned from scratch, commencing his career as a compositor. From 2007 onwards, Terao transitioned to the role of \"Director of Photography\" in notable works such as \"The Garden of Sinners.\" Presently serving as Chief of ufotable's Digital Imaging Department, he oversees photography and CG, contributing significantly to ufotable's works. Beyond photography and CG, Terao actively engages in various roles, including animation, background sections, directing, and storyboarding, even participating in the early stages of background art creation. Noteworthy for his involvement in promotional videos and commercials, Terao gained attention for creating faction-specific commercials for the TV anime [Fate/Zero](https://anilist.co/anime/10087/FateZero/) in 2011. \n\nHis directorial contributions extend to ufotable works' opening sequences and game animations, with a notable debut as a storyboard artist and director in the final episode of the 2019 TV anime [Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/). Terao's multifaceted contributions align with his belief in animation as a collective art form, emphasizing teamwork in production. \n\nRecognized for his expertise in integrating 3DCG seamlessly with characters and background art, Terao's artistic approach aims for high-quality animation. His \"photorealistic\" visuals, adopted since 2007, have been praised, contributing to his receipt of the Tokyo Anime Award 2022's \"Individual Award\".",

With little prior experience in drawing, he began honing his skills under the guidance of renowned art director [Masanori Kikuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/156492/Masanori-Kikuchi). He transitioned to Studio Easter in 2003, specializing in background art production, and later served as art director for various anime series including [Speed Grapher](https://anilist.co/anime/198/Speed-Grapher/), [Steins;Gate](https://anilist.co/anime/9253/SteinsGate/) and [Psycho-Pass](https://anilist.co/anime/13601/PSYCHOPASS/).\n\nHis involvement with ufotable's theatrical production \"The Garden of Sinners\" began when a superior at Studio Easter asked for his assistance. Initially planning to contribute only a few cuts, he ended up handling nearly 50 cuts of art in the [Chapter 5](https://anilist.co/anime/4282/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-5-Paradox-Paradigm/). Recognizing his talent, Studio Easter's representative recommended him for the art director role in the [Chapter 6](https://anilist.co/anime/5204/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-6-Fairy-Tale-Oblivion-Recording/) and [Chapter 7](https://anilist.co/anime/5205/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-7-not-nothing-heart-Murder-Speculation-Part-B/).\n\nIn 2013, he made a significant career move, transitioning from Studio Easter to ufotable's art department. This shift was prompted by individual requests from ufotable for his involvement in projects like the anime series [Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works](https://anilist.co/anime/19603/Fatestay-night-Unlimited-Blade-Works/). At ufotable, he served as the art director for numerous projects, contributing to the development of the in-house art team alongside ufotable's art department chief, [Kazuo Ebisawa](https://anilist.co/staff/115408/Kazuo-Ebisawa).\n\nOn February 9, 2023, he was honored with the [Individual Award in the Art, Color, and Visual Effects](https://animefestival.jp/en/award/aoy/archive/#2023) category at the Tokyo Anime Awards 2023.",
