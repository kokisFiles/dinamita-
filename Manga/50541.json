  "description": "Lady Snowbload returns after a 20 year long hiatus! Ikegami Ryoichi takes over the art while Kazuo Koike continues to deliver the same writing that made Lady Snowblood a hit originally. This volume contains three stories that take place after the original series. A politician and his wife try to lure Yuki out of retirement to exact their vengeance. A Buddhist nun tries to escape her sisters and bring the true teachings of her sect to the populace with a stolen mandala. She is rescued by Yuki but terribly wounded in the process. A police official tries to get Yuki to assassinate another assassin.\n",

Despite his age, his first two collaborative efforts (1973's <i>AIUEO Boy</i> with Kazuo Koike and 1974's <i>Otoko Gumi</i> with Tetsu Kariya) proved so popular they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators.\n",

          "description": "__Height__: 183 cm\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kazuo_Koike/)\n\nKoike was a prolific Japanese manga writer, novelist and entrepreneur. \n\nEarly in Koike's career, he studied under *Golgo 13* creator [Takao Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/97907/Takao-Saitou) and served as a writer on the series. \n\nKoike, along with artist Goseki Kojima, made the manga [Kozure Ookami](https://anilist.co/manga/30904/Kozure-Ookami/), and Koike also contributed to the scripts for the 1970s film adaptations of the series, which starred famous Japanese actor Tomisaburo Wakayama. Koike and Kojima became known as the \"Golden Duo\" because of the success of Kozure Ookami.  Another series written by Koike, [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/manga/31449/Crying-Freeman/), which was illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, was adapted into a 1995 live-action film by French director Christophe Gans.  Kazuo Koike started the Gekika Sonjuku, a college course meant to teach people how to be mangaka.\n\nIn addition to his more violent, action-oriented manga, Koike, an avid golfer, has also written golf manga.",
