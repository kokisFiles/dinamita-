He soon stopped showing up at Telecom because of all the in-betweening work he was given, and was thus fired. He then joined the production of [Royal Space Force](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), but quit after a week. He then gave up on being an animator and started working part-time jobs while trying to get a manga serialization. At this time, he was living with [Kazuyoshi Yaginuma](https://anilist.co/staff/133410/), who convinced him to take part in [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as a key animator.\n\nHe was heavily influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) during [Gosenzo-sama Banbanzai](https://anilist.co/anime/4639/)'s production.",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Among his work in the first half of 2000s was his performance of RTB - the ending song to the anime Sentou Yousei Yukikaze. In 2009 he released an anniversary album that he recorded together with a large group of famous music artists.\n\nHe was going strong performing for over five decades, often being considered a true legend in Japan. On 1 March 2017 he died from pancreatic cancer, aged 78. His wife died earlier in February of the same year.",

          "description": "A deeply influential animator of the '80s OVA boom.\n\nWhile still in highschool he was influenced by [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/) and [Kazuhide Tomonaga](https://anilist.co/staff/110219/), joining the former at Studio No.1 once he graduated. After half a year doing in-betweens he debuted as key animator on [New Tetsujin 28](https://anilist.co/anime/4208/) at the age of 19. \n\nHe was known for pushing his mentor's style to the extreme, with even more exagerated poses and flashier effects, becoming in the process as influential as Kanada himself. Some animators who followed his school are [Shinya Oohira](https://anilist.co/staff/103893/) and [Jun Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/114916/). \n\nAt the end of the '90s he was an employee at Square (SQUARE ENIX) and participated on [Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within](https://anilist.co/anime/1361/) as a storyboarder. He left the company soon thereafter but not before working on Final Fantasy X as battle image board designer. ",
