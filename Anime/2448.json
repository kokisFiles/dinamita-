          "description": "Kanno's earliest experiences with music came from attending church with her parents. She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

          "description": "Nishio graduated from Nagoya Designer Academy and started his career at Anime Spot, a subcontracting studio, after being refused in interviews with several animation studios. He debuted as an in-betweener on [Osomatsu-kun](https://anilist.co/anime/9883/) and as a key animator on [Laughing Salesman](https://anilist.co/anime/3077/).\n\nIt's on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392//) that Nishio came into his own as an animator, developing weighty and realistic movements influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). Thanks to the ability demonstrated there, he was chosen to design the characters for [Ninku](https://anilist.co/anime/912/).\n\nAfter working as character designer and chief animation director on [Jin-Roh](https://anilist.co/anime/570/) he permanently joined Production I.G. where he became known, together with [Hiroyuki Okiura](https://anilist.co/staff/103502/) and [Kazuchika Kise](https://anilist.co/staff/115781/), as \"The Three Gods of I.G.\"\n\n[Masashi Kishimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96879/) requested for Nishio to be the character designer of the Naruto anime.\n\nIn August 2020, he was promoted to company director of Production I.G alongside [Takayuki Gotou](https://anilist.co/staff/103266/Takayuki-Gotou/), a co-founder of the studio.",
