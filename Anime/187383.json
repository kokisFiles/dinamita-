With little prior experience in drawing, he began honing his skills under the guidance of renowned art director [Masanori Kikuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/156492/Masanori-Kikuchi). He transitioned to Studio Easter in 2003, specializing in background art production, and later served as art director for various anime series including [Speed Grapher](https://anilist.co/anime/198/Speed-Grapher/), [Steins;Gate](https://anilist.co/anime/9253/SteinsGate/) and [Psycho-Pass](https://anilist.co/anime/13601/PSYCHOPASS/).\n\nHis involvement with ufotable's theatrical production \"The Garden of Sinners\" began when a superior at Studio Easter asked for his assistance. Initially planning to contribute only a few cuts, he ended up handling nearly 50 cuts of art in the [Chapter 5](https://anilist.co/anime/4282/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-5-Paradox-Paradigm/). Recognizing his talent, Studio Easter's representative recommended him for the art director role in the [Chapter 6](https://anilist.co/anime/5204/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-6-Fairy-Tale-Oblivion-Recording/) and [Chapter 7](https://anilist.co/anime/5205/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-7-not-nothing-heart-Murder-Speculation-Part-B/).\n\nIn 2013, he made a significant career move, transitioning from Studio Easter to ufotable's art department. This shift was prompted by individual requests from ufotable for his involvement in projects like the anime series [Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works](https://anilist.co/anime/19603/Fatestay-night-Unlimited-Blade-Works/). At ufotable, he served as the art director for numerous projects, contributing to the development of the in-house art team alongside ufotable's art department chief, [Kazuo Ebisawa](https://anilist.co/staff/115408/Kazuo-Ebisawa).\n\nOn February 9, 2023, he was honored with the [Individual Award in the Art, Color, and Visual Effects](https://animefestival.jp/en/award/aoy/archive/#2023) category at the Tokyo Anime Awards 2023.",
