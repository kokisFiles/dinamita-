Ichise, an orphan turned prize fighter, loses a leg and an arm to satisfy an enraged fight promoter. On the brink of death he is taken in by a young woman doctor and used as a guinea pig for the next evolution of Texhnolyze. With his new limbs, Ichise is taken under the wing of Oonishi, a powerful leader of Organ, an organization with some hold on Lux. As Ichise is drawn deeper into a war for territorial control of the city, he learns of his possible future from the young girl prophet Ran, who guides him from the shadows in his darkest times. With the explosion of the warfare, Ichise must uncover the truth about Lux and fight for his survival as he realizes his destiny.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

During his third year of high school Koike came to Tokyo and quickly got a job at [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and got thrown straight into [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/)'s projects. He made his debut as an in-betweener on [Phoenix: Karma Chapter](https://anilist.co/anime/2997/) and as a key animator on [Goku: Midnight Eye](https://anilist.co/anime/1879/).\n\nHis first venture into directing was in year 2000, when he got to direct the opening of Party 7, a film directed by [Katsuhito Ishii](https://anilist.co/staff/102102/). Koike also acted as the character designer and animation director on the film, getting to fully display his influences from above-mentioned legendary animator Yoshinori Kanada as well as Mike Mignola, an American comic artist of Hellboy fame.\n\nSome time after this began the notoriously lengthy seven year production of [Redline](https://anilist.co/anime/6675/). The film was eventually released in August 2009. Despite the positive critical response, with particular praise for its animation, Redline didn't have a successful run at the box office. It did however see a much greater success after its home release and has since been recognized as a cult film.",
