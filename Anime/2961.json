          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hosodamamoru)\n\nHosoda initially felt inspired to take up animation as a career after seeing [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/), the first film directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). He majored in oil painting at the Kanazawa College of Art in Ishikawa Prefecture. After graduation, Hosoda was able to land an animation job at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/), after submitting a short film that he had animated in his spare time. He initially applied at [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/); though he did not get the job, he received a rejection letter of praise from Hayao Miyazaki himself.\n\nDuring his time at Toei, Hosoda worked his way up, garnering public attention in the early 2000s with the first two films in the Digimon series. It was his first co-directed film, [Digimon: The Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2961/), which attracted the eye of Ghibli head producer [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/).\n\nStudio Ghibli announced that Hosoda was to direct the film [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/) in September 2001. This was scheduled for a summer 2003 release. However, production on the film became strained due to creative differences. According to Hosoda, he \"was told to make the movie similar to how Miyazaki would have made it, but he wanted to make his own film the way he wanted to make it\". In the end, Hosoda left in the summer of 2002 during the early production stages, after failing to come up with a concept acceptable to Studio Ghibli bosses.\n\nProceeding his departure from Ghibli, Hosoda returned to Toei and worked on a few animations in collaboration with artist Takashi Murakami, such as the commercial Superflat Monogram for Louis Vuitton. During this time, he directed an episode of [Ojamajo Doremi](https://anilist.co/anime/353/), which was inspired by his turbulent time at Ghibli. This episode led to him being hired at the animation studio [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), which he worked at from 2005 to 2011.\n\nAt Madhouse, Hosoda earned critical acclaim with his directing efforts. His two movies, [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/) and [Summer Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/5681/), both won the Japan Academy Film Prize award.\n\nIn 2011, Hosoda left Madhouse to establish his own animation studio, [Studio Chizu](https://anilist.co/studio/555/), with Yuuichirou Saitou who produced both previously mentioned award winning shows. As of August 2020, Studio Chizu has released three films directed by Hosoda: 2012's [Wolf Children](https://anilist.co/anime/12355/), 2015's [The Boy and the Beast](https://anilist.co/anime/20981/), and 2018's [Mirai](https://anilist.co/anime/100749/). Which of Mirai was nominated for Best Animated Feature for the 2019 Oscars.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n__Notable Awards:__\n\n- **The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2007)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2007)\n\\- Winner, Best Animation of the Year (Japan Academy Film Prize 2007)\n\n- **Summer Wars**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Original Story (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Notable Entry (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Animation of the Year (Japan Academy Film Prize 2010)\n\n- **Wolf Children**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Best Screenplay (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Notable Entry (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\n- **Mirai**\n\\- Nominee, Best Animated Feature Film (Academy Awards, USA)\n\n(Source: IMDb)",

He made his initial splash in [Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket](https://anilist.co/anime/82/), and continued to develop his approach to animation which he calls \"full limited,\" which eliminated the pose-to-pose feel of conventional keyframe animation. His characteristic animation can be seen in [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) and [End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/).\n\nIn [Blood: The Last Vampire](https://anilist.co/anime/405/), Iso experimented with digital processing of his hand-drawn fire effects, elevating it to uncanny realism. Iso then got his first taste of directing in [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/) episode 15, which he largely animated and also digitally processed himself.\n\nHis animation sensibilities, process innovations, experience in multiple levels of anime production, and interest in technology culminated in the 2007 sci-fi series, [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/), his veritable brainchild. During its production, there was a rumored falling-out with key staff. For the next several years, Iso would quietly animate under the pseudonym Mikio Odagawa.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2018, he announced his retirement as an animator to focus exclusively on directing.",

          "description": "Hamasu's animation mainly focuses on character acting, and his scenes often feature minimal camerawork with a heavy emphasis on expressive facial and body animation. Much like [Kouichi Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/121208/), he was heavily influenced by [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/) and the late '80s realism. Early in his career he was employed at Toei Animation, and was thus a recurring presence in the studio's OVA works such as [Xanadu](https://anilist.co/anime/5920/), [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/anime/1153/) and [Vampire Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/1765/). His rising prominence during the early '90s allowed him to participate on [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), and from thereon he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\nIn 1993, Hamasu animated the car chase on [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)’s episode of the [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/). The scene impressed Kon enough for Hamasu to end up as a character designer and animation director on [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/). He was also set to serve a similar role in [Millennium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), but was replaced in the role by [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/) due to having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. He appeared on all of Kon’s films, as well as [Paranoia Agent](https://anilist.co/anime/323/) until the director's passing.\n\nMore recently he has mostly worked on [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) and [Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/)'s films.",

          "description": "Takanori Arisawa was a Japanese composer and arranger from Tokyo. He wrote the background music for several notable anime, including the award-winning soundtrack of the Sailor Moon anime series.    He died of bladder cancer at 54 years of age.    As the Music Director for Sailor Moon, Arisawa's first award was the 1993 Golden Disk Grand Prize from Columbia Records. He continued to compose for the entire anime series, plus several video games and some of the stage musicals. In 1998, 2000, and 2001 he won the JASRAC International Award for most international royalties, owing largely to the popularity of Sailor Moon music in other nations.    Arisawa expressed an admiration of Hollywood-style music, drawing his initial inspiration for the tone of the Sailor Moon soundtrack from the Charlie's Angels TV series. He frequently made use of symbolism when writing themes for specific characters or groups, borrowing thematic elements from diverse genres and from other countries. As the series progressed, his music gravitated from a pop feeling toward more classical arrangements to represent the protagonist having passed through painful experiences and grown as a person.
