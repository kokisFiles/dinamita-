  "description": "There is an ancient legend on a distant planet which states (among other things) that four goddesses will one day descend from the skies and all will be right with the world. <br><br>\nOf course meanwhile, Yohko and the rest of the Terra team (with one straggler) have crashed on a backwater world, and they have to figure out a way off before their new charge... gets hungry again! <br><br>\nEvery so often, a celebration takes place in one of the most beautiful places in the Universe... a cosmic Sakura fest! Since the Terra Team has been doing so well, one of them is invited to join the high command as they meet their opposite numbers from NESS. It's a time of celebration and a time of peace... but it seems that someone didn't get the message.<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/新房昭之) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Shinbo)\n\nAkiyuki Shinbou is a Japanese director, producer, animator and storyboard artist. He joined Studio One Pattern in 1981. He made his directorial debut with [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/) in 1994. He joined Shaft in 2004. He has received the 11th Tokyo Anime Award and the 2011 Newtype Anime Award for Best director for his work on the acclaimed anime series [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/).\n\nShinbou was born in Fukushima Prefecture. After high school, he attended Tokyo Designer Institute before entering the anime industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo Design Institute, Shinbou worked as an animator for the 1981 anime series [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/). Shinbou participated with Studio Pierrot in 1990 as an episode director in [Musashi](https://anilist.co/anime/8065/). His first full directorial debut was however the previously mentioned, with Metal Fighter Miku. He continued his early directional career with several OVA series in the late 90's. Shinbou participated with Seven Arcs starting with [Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever](https://anilist.co/anime/176/) in 2003 and then became director for 2004's spin-off [Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha](https://anilist.co/anime/76/).\n\nHis style in particular became noticed during his episode direction work on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/)'s Dark Tournament arc. After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies. In an interview, Kubota cited [Le Portrait de Petit Cossette](https://anilist.co/anime/514/) and [The SoulTaker](https://anilist.co/anime/1048/) among Shinbou's most distinctive products that caught his eye.\n\nHis work at Shaft has been characterized by extensive experimentation within the visual medium of animation, and often includes pictures taken from real life cut into scenes, as well as art shifts, beat panels, kabuki sound effects, textures that remain stationary when the textured object moves, showing symbols or defining parts of a character in place of characters during dialogue, written text in place (in opposition to dialogue), precise use of fan service, and \"head-tilting\", a style known as a Shaft specialty.\n\nHe says that the reason he sticks with Shaft is due to their system and professional capacity, which make his expression of direction much easier. The so-called \"Team Shinbou\" includes himself, [Tatsuya Oishi](https://anilist.co/staff/103552/) and [Shin Oonuma](https://anilist.co/staff/101753/).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Aspired to become an animator simply because he wanted to draw for a living. Later enrolled to and graduated from Tokyo Animator Gakuin. He then joined [Magic Bus](https://anilist.co/studio/207/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1987 under the studio's name on [God Bless Dancougar](https://anilist.co/anime/5266/). Nakazawa soon left Magic Bus and went freelance. In 1993, he was involved in the establishment of Studio G-1, an animation studio founded by [Masami Oobari](https://anilist.co/staff/100660/). During his time there he participated in many of [AIC](https://anilist.co/studio/48/)'s productions. Nakazawa got strongly influenced by Oobari during this time due to working under him on multiple occasions. Also unlike most animators at the time, Nakazawa wasn't really that shaped by [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s style, he was though, a huge fan of [Ichirou Itano](https://anilist.co/staff/103268/)'s and [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s.\n\nIn 2002, Nakazawa made his directorial debut with Comedy, part of an anthology titled [Sweat Punch](https://anilist.co/anime/1072/), produced by [Studio 4°C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/). The following year he directed both [Parasite Dolls](https://anilist.co/anime/1350/) jointly with [Naoyuki Yoshinaga](https://anilist.co/staff/115038/), as well as the animated part in Quentin Tarantino's movie, Kill Bill: Volume 1. This brought him a lot of international praise. He then got reached out to by director [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) of [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/) fame, about the possiblity of taking part in the director's next work, [Samurai Champloo](https://anilist.co/anime/205/). Nakazawa accepted the offer and ended up being a crucial part of its production, handling the character designs and serving as the sole chief animation director on the show. He also directed, storyboarded and wrote the 15th episode. Ten years later in 2014, Nakazawa collaborated with Watanabe for the second time on [Terror in Resonance](https://anilist.co/anime/20661/), providing the character designs and working as an animation director on the series.\n\nIn recent years he has been closely involved with [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/).",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/新房昭之) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Shinbo)\n\nAkiyuki Shinbou is a Japanese director, producer, animator and storyboard artist. He joined Studio One Pattern in 1981. He made his directorial debut with [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/) in 1994. He joined Shaft in 2004. He has received the 11th Tokyo Anime Award and the 2011 Newtype Anime Award for Best director for his work on the acclaimed anime series [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/).\n\nShinbou was born in Fukushima Prefecture. After high school, he attended Tokyo Designer Institute before entering the anime industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo Design Institute, Shinbou worked as an animator for the 1981 anime series [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/). Shinbou participated with Studio Pierrot in 1990 as an episode director in [Musashi](https://anilist.co/anime/8065/). His first full directorial debut was however the previously mentioned, with Metal Fighter Miku. He continued his early directional career with several OVA series in the late 90's. Shinbou participated with Seven Arcs starting with [Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever](https://anilist.co/anime/176/) in 2003 and then became director for 2004's spin-off [Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha](https://anilist.co/anime/76/).\n\nHis style in particular became noticed during his episode direction work on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/)'s Dark Tournament arc. After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies. In an interview, Kubota cited [Le Portrait de Petit Cossette](https://anilist.co/anime/514/) and [The SoulTaker](https://anilist.co/anime/1048/) among Shinbou's most distinctive products that caught his eye.\n\nHis work at Shaft has been characterized by extensive experimentation within the visual medium of animation, and often includes pictures taken from real life cut into scenes, as well as art shifts, beat panels, kabuki sound effects, textures that remain stationary when the textured object moves, showing symbols or defining parts of a character in place of characters during dialogue, written text in place (in opposition to dialogue), precise use of fan service, and \"head-tilting\", a style known as a Shaft specialty.\n\nHe says that the reason he sticks with Shaft is due to their system and professional capacity, which make his expression of direction much easier. The so-called \"Team Shinbou\" includes himself, [Tatsuya Oishi](https://anilist.co/staff/103552/) and [Shin Oonuma](https://anilist.co/staff/101753/).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
