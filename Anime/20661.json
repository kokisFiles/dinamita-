  "description": "Painted in red, the word \"VON\" is all that is left behind after a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility in Japan. The government is shattered by their inability to act, and the police are left frantically searching for ways to crack down the perpetrators. The public are clueless—until, six months later, a strange video makes its way onto the internet. In it, two teenage boys who identify themselves only as \"Sphinx\" directly challenge the police, threatening to cause destruction and mayhem across Tokyo. Unable to stop the mass panic quickly spreading through the city and desperate for any leads in their investigation, the police struggle to act effectively against these terrorists, with Detective Kenjirou Shibazaki caught in the middle of it all.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Zankyou no Terror</i> tells the story of Nine and Twelve, the two boys behind the masked figures of Sphinx. They should not exist, yet they stand strong in a world of deception and secrets while they make the city fall around them, all in the hopes of burying their own tragic truth.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

          "description": "Kanno's earliest experiences with music came from attending church with her parents. She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

          "description": "Aspired to become an animator simply because he wanted to draw for a living. Later enrolled to and graduated from Tokyo Animator Gakuin. He then joined [Magic Bus](https://anilist.co/studio/207/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1987 under the studio's name on [God Bless Dancougar](https://anilist.co/anime/5266/). Nakazawa soon left Magic Bus and went freelance. In 1993, he was involved in the establishment of Studio G-1, an animation studio founded by [Masami Oobari](https://anilist.co/staff/100660/). During his time there he participated in many of [AIC](https://anilist.co/studio/48/)'s productions. Nakazawa got strongly influenced by Oobari during this time due to working under him on multiple occasions. Also unlike most animators at the time, Nakazawa wasn't really that shaped by [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s style, he was though, a huge fan of [Ichirou Itano](https://anilist.co/staff/103268/)'s and [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s.\n\nIn 2002, Nakazawa made his directorial debut with Comedy, part of an anthology titled [Sweat Punch](https://anilist.co/anime/1072/), produced by [Studio 4°C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/). The following year he directed both [Parasite Dolls](https://anilist.co/anime/1350/) jointly with [Naoyuki Yoshinaga](https://anilist.co/staff/115038/), as well as the animated part in Quentin Tarantino's movie, Kill Bill: Volume 1. This brought him a lot of international praise. He then got reached out to by director [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) of [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/) fame, about the possiblity of taking part in the director's next work, [Samurai Champloo](https://anilist.co/anime/205/). Nakazawa accepted the offer and ended up being a crucial part of its production, handling the character designs and serving as the sole chief animation director on the show. He also directed, storyboarded and wrote the 15th episode. Ten years later in 2014, Nakazawa collaborated with Watanabe for the second time on [Terror in Resonance](https://anilist.co/anime/20661/), providing the character designs and working as an animation director on the series.\n\nIn recent years he has been closely involved with [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/).",

Her name comes from the verb \"aimer\" in French which means \"to love.\" She is known for being a faceless voice. She very rarely appears on her music videos and most of her live performances are dimly lit to obscure her face. She finally revealed herself on the August 20, 2016 episode of Music Station.\n\nHer father was the bassist of a band, so Aimer grew up surrounded by music from a very young age. She began studying the piano in elementary school and highly looked up to Ringo Sheena and Utada Hikaru. In junior high school, listening to Avril Lavigne inspired her to take up guitar and began writing English lyrics. At the age of 15, Aimer lost her voice due to over-usage of her vocal cords and was forced to undergo silence therapy for treatment. However, that did not stop her, and after she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky voice.\n\nAimer teamed up with the \"Agehasprings\" group, which has worked with, produced, or provided music for various artists, including Yuki, Mika Nakashima, Flumpool, Superfly, Yuzu, and Genki Rockets. In 2011, her musical career began in earnest. In May 2011, they released the concept album \"Your Favorite Things.\" It covered numerous popular works, including works in various genre such as jazz and country western music.\n\nMarried [Masahiro Tobinai](https://anilist.co/staff/146979/Masahiro-Tobinai) in 2023.",

          "description": "POP ETC, formerly known as The Morning Benders is an indie-alternative group from Berkeley, California. Its members are Chris Chu, Jon Chu, and Julian Harmon.\n\nThe Morning Benders started in 2005 as a solo-project for Chris Chu. During that time, he spent his days studying music at the University of California, Berkeley whilst spending his nights recording songs from a laptop. As time passed, he formed a band with friends who he had met in UC Berkeley.\n\nThe band did all they could to spread word about The Morning Benders; playing in local gigs, making lots of friends on MySpace, emailing bloggers and conversing with club promoters. This led to offers from various local independent labels. The Morning Benders had chosen +1 Records to support them in recording their albums.\n\nReleasing several CDs afterwards, and even touring the USA with other indie artists, they signed with Rough Trade Records on 15.12.2009. Under their old name they released 2 studio albums, 7 EPs, 3 Singles, and two releases that can only be grouped under other. They appeared on 4 different compilation albums, including the soundtrack of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2.\n\nThe band announced their new name on 25.03.2012, releasing a self-titled album afterwards.\n\n(Source: Anidb)",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
