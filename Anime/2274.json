During his third year of high school Koike came to Tokyo and quickly got a job at [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and got thrown straight into [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/)'s projects. He made his debut as an in-betweener on [Phoenix: Karma Chapter](https://anilist.co/anime/2997/) and as a key animator on [Goku: Midnight Eye](https://anilist.co/anime/1879/).\n\nHis first venture into directing was in year 2000, when he got to direct the opening of Party 7, a film directed by [Katsuhito Ishii](https://anilist.co/staff/102102/). Koike also acted as the character designer and animation director on the film, getting to fully display his influences from above-mentioned legendary animator Yoshinori Kanada as well as Mike Mignola, an American comic artist of Hellboy fame.\n\nSome time after this began the notoriously lengthy seven year production of [Redline](https://anilist.co/anime/6675/). The film was eventually released in August 2009. Despite the positive critical response, with particular praise for its animation, Redline didn't have a successful run at the box office. It did however see a much greater success after its home release and has since been recognized as a cult film.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/136171134)\n\nA long-serving anime producer, as well as a founder of [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/) and [Studio M2](https://anilist.co/studio/6137/). He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

His notable works include [Cardcaptor Sakura](https://anilist.co/anime/232/), [Nana](https://anilist.co/anime/877/), [Chihayafuru](https://anilist.co/anime/10800/), and [My Love Story!!](https://anilist.co/anime/20946/) among others.\n\nMany of his works take on a female perspective for the telling of the story, with a feminine protagonist as the central focus. This has contributed to him becoming the main director at Madhouse for handling the more serious series featuring female characters or targeting the female market.",

          "description": "[Website](http://www.clamp-net.com) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CLAMP_news) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clamp_4_official/)\n\nCLAMP is an all-female Japanese manga artist group that formed in the mid-1980s. It consists of leader [Nanase Ohkawa](https://anilist.co/staff/97292), and three artists who shift roles for each series: [Mokona](https://anilist.co/staff/100802) (もこな), [Tsubaki Nekoi](https://anilist.co/staff/100804), and Satsuki Igarashi (いがらし寒月). Almost 100 million CLAMP tankōbon copies have been sold worldwide as of October 2007.\n\nIn general, Ohkawa gets her inspiration for the group from everyday events such as dreams or the news. Unlike most manga artists who specialize in a single genre, CLAMP has created a diverse body of work. CLAMP's genres vary widely, from childish and comedic (<i>Cardcaptor Sakura, Clamp School Detectives</i>) to more dramatic and teen-rated (<i>xxxHolic, X</i>) series. Furthermore, drawing from the idea of Osamu Tezuka's <i>Star System</i> as they did in <i>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle</i>, CLAMP often crossover characters from their own series into their other works, which gives rise to a loosely defined \"Clamp Universe\".",
