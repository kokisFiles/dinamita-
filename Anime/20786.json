Deunan and Briareos befriend with them and decide to join their mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris is tasked with preventing the malevolent cyborg Talos from capturing a secret weapon humans were building. Talos uses Iris to activate the gigantic war machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

One of his first representative works was an independently produced animation titled \"Moonstruck Artemis,\" that he made while part of a manga club during his university days. Aramaki didn't have a special desire to work in the animation industry, but has stated joining it solely because he could draw and the industry had a wide range of options for someone like that. He has also said that the spread of digital technology has made it easier for him to work in both anime and live-action.\n\nIn 2004, Aramaki directed [Appleseed](https://anilist.co/anime/54/), a re-interpretation of a [Shirou Masamune](https://anilist.co/staff/97609/) manga by [the same name](https://anilist.co/manga/30668/). Although bashed by critics, the movie was an influential piece in the medium that had great impact on creators around the world. Studio Ghibli co-founder [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) said the movie would reform the industry.",

While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, Black Magic, which was published in the manga dōjinshi Atlas. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.\n\nThe result was best-selling manga Appleseed, a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of Black Magic and a second volume of Appleseed, he released Dominion in 1986. Two more volumes of Appleseed followed before he began work on Ghost in the Shell.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated again with Production I.G to co-create the original concept for the anime television series Shinreigari/Ghost Hound, Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with Production I.G began airing in April 2008, titled Real Drive.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
