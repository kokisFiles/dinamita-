  "description": "It began in 1945, at the end of the Pacific War. Alien invaders filled the earth's Skies, and mankind was forced to confront an unprecedented threat. For the first time in human history, people of all cultures came together under one banner.<br><br>\r\nThis war has now been raging for over fifty years. Countless lives have been lost, and the Japanese military is now forced to rely on young people such as Atsushi Hayami and his high school class, also known as Unit 5121. This new generation fearlessly struggles on with the aid of the HWT humanoid combat machines and the devastating PBE bomb.<br><br>\r\n(Source: Media Blasters)",

However, he dropped out after half a year. With a few friends, he created the band Muse, playing fusion rock and participating in music competitions.

He contributed music to horror films: Ring, Ring 2, Dark Water, Japanese-Polish science-fiction film Avalon and the Hong Kong film Seven Swords.\n\nFor the music found in Seven Swords and A Battle of Wits he was nominated for Best Original Film Score Awards at both the 25th and 26th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2006 and 2007.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

He tends to work together with character designer [Kyuuta Sakai](https://anilist.co/staff/106111/), whose disproportionated character designs particularly fit his style, employing often large teardrops, which brought him to spotlight in [Higurashi no Naku Koro ni](https://anilist.co/anime/934/). The duo also participated together in several other shows, such as [Ichigo Mashimaro](https://anilist.co/anime/488/) and [Strawberry Panic](https://anilist.co/anime/855/).\n\nEvery now and then works under one of his many pseudonyms.\n\n(Source: Anidb)",
