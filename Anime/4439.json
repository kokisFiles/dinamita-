          "description": "Legendary sakuga animator critical to the development of Japanese TV animation. No less than Yoshinori Kanada and Masaaki Yuasa have cited him as an influence.\n\nDidn’t fit the nerdy animator stereotype in his youth. Growing up Kimura was known as a tough guy, bulky and confrontational. However, he loved painting as a hobby and when he couldn’t get into his art college of choice he joined Toei as an animator. Mentored by Yasuo Otsuka. Even in his earliest drawings, Kimura was extremely idiosyncratic: his lineart was rough and sketchy, but at the same time he paid more attention to human anatomy than all of his peers. Kimura’s cuts stood out for their rawness and epitomized the tendency in early TV anime towards highly stylized individual drawings in lieu of full animation.\n\nA staple of Toei’s early experiments in TV animation. He was animation director and character designer for both the television and film incarnations of Cyborg 009 and animated the OP. He served a similar role on Rainbow Sentai Robin. Kimura’s masterpiece was his character designs and animation direction on Toei’s breakthrough wrestling series Tiger Mask. Kimura personally animated the OP and was AD on a number of episodes (1, 7, 11, 21, 27, 36, 49, 51, 58, 64, 71, 82). His drawings were inspired by the bold, expressionistic movie poster illustrations of Bob Peak.\n\nFollowing Tiger Mask, Kimura animated for a number of major 70s anime. He was often typecasted for OPs, like those he did for Atack No. 1 and Gatchaman. He was also a regular animator on the first Lupin III TV anime. After leaving Toei he formed his own subcontracting studio Neo Media and spent most of his career from the 80s onward training younger animators, though he still animates from time to time.\n\nRecently participated in a kickstarter, Go Samurai, which intends to make a short film out of Kimura’s uncorrected B&W pencil drawings.\n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/keiichiro-kimura/)",

          "description": "Tatsuo Yoshida an anime pioneer who founded anime studio Tatsunoko Productions.\n\nBorn in 1932, Yoshida grew up in the hardship of war-torn Japan. A self-taught artist, his first job was as working for local newspapers in Kyoto. After finding success as a manga artist in Tokyo, including winning the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1972 for Minashigo Hutch, in 1962 he founded Tatsunoko with his two younger brothers, Kenji (who took over Tatsuo's position as producer after he died) and Toyoharu (a.k.a. Kuri Ippei). The studio's name has a double Japanese meaning of \"Tatsu's child\" and \"sea dragon\" which was the inspiration for its seahorse logo.\n\nUnderstanding the future of television, Yoshida made the jump from print to the screen and found modest success with the anime racing series Mach Go Go Go. Once adapted to the English language market, it would achieve Blockbuster status as Speed Racer around the world. Yoshida's magical talent for storytelling again found success with the action series Gatchaman (also known as Battle of the Planets) and Casshan (now remade as the live-action film Casshern).\n\nThough Yoshida Tatsuo's brilliant career was cut short by his untimely death from liver cancer in 1977, Tatsunoko Productions has continued to partner with top creators to create additional hit series such as Macross (Robotech), Mospeada, Generator Gawl, Time Bokan, and Karas.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
