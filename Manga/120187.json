  "description": "\"Welcome to the Kujou Mansion,\" the man found himself standing in front of a strange Western-style building. It was a beautiful doll that spoke to him, a doll that drew him in from the second the amnesiac man saw her. The doll named Mary pointed out the strange mark on the man's arm as being an omen of death. If he didn't confront the \"spirit\" that gave him the mark, he would die before dawn.<br><br>\nAlong with other \"Mark Bearers\", the protagonist confronts the \"spirits\" who marked them while fighting for their lives against the clock. Is survival possible, and why was the protagonist marked in the first place?<br><br>\n(Source: Japanese Publisher, translated)<br><br>\nNovel adaption of the game <i>Shiin</i> that contains new content not available in the game, including background information on the cast.",
