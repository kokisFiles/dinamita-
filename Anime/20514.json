They were born in 1973, but the month and day are unknown.  Amano began in 1998 with a job at Weekly Young Magazine. They also held a job at Shueisha Publishing Co, Ltd.  In 2002, Amano participated in a contest for aspiring mangaka and was one of the lucky winners, with their comic Monkey Business published in Young Magazine.  In 2004, they finally found success with the humorous and classy manga Katekyo Hitman Reborn! (or, for short, just Reborn!), and that thanks to their readers' support. This new manga was advertised more and more in Shonen Jump and became a hit. Two years later, their manga was made into an anime series by Artland studios. \n\nTheir ideas for Reborn!: Amano had some crazy ideas to entertain readers with. They came up with weird characters to add spice to the humor, a story written especially to be unique, and fast-paced action.    \n\nOther works:  Boy Spin (1998)  Hot Blast Baseball Legendary (1999)  Pu Chipu Chirabii (2000)  Monkey Business (2002)  Tapir Hearts HAWK!
