  "description": "Many years have passed since humanity was driven to the brink of extinction by the sudden emergence of the unknown life forms Gadoll. Those humans that survived now dwell in a 3000 meter-high mobile fortress Deca-dence built to protect themselves from the Gadoll threat.<br>\n<br>\nDenizens of Deca-dence fall into two categories: Gears, warriors who fight the Gadoll daily, and Tankers, those without the skills to fight. One day, Natsume, a Tanker girl who dreams of becoming a Gear meets surly Kaburagi, an armor repairman of Deca-dence.<br>\n<br>\nThis chance meeting between the seemingly two opposites, the girl with a positive attitude who never gives up on her dreams and the realist who has given up on his, will eventually shake the future course of this world.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Funimation)",

He is known as a musician who uses a fox mask as his trademark, and he is personally under the record label Izanagi Record (2017–), having previously been under record label TOY'S FACTORY (2014–2016).\n\n__Biography:__\nHe has been active as a musician since 2011, where he would start posting covers on the platform Nico Nico Douga as an utaite. He would later in 2012 release a self-produced album titled \"my little white cat\", while making his major debut through TOY'S FACTORY in 2014.\n\nAfter releasing his second full album (which peaked 6th in the weekly Oricon ranking), to releasing a CD titled \"Hoshineko\", while also performing live at festivals, or as a one-man live under TOY'S FACTORY between 2014 to 2016, he would on October 4, 2017 release his third full album titled \"Niten Ichiryu\" while also establishing his own independent record label called \"Izanagi Record\" in 2017.\n\nHe would at the end of January 2018 undergo a surgery for his vocal cord nodules, resulting in him going on hiatus until he was able to perform again. He was allowed to talk on March 12, and would later be allowed to sing again on May 11 of the same year. During this time he wrote and published a book titled \"[Home Classroom](https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/product/321709000163/)\", which would become his debut work as a writer.\n\nFrom August 31, 2019 to October 20, 2019, he went on a one-man live tour around Japan. Later from November 2, 2019 to November 17, 2019, he went on another one-man live tour around Japan as an extension to the previous one. And from December 7, 2019 to December 8, 2019, he went on a one-man live tour that was held in Chengdu and Guangzhou in China.\n\nOn [May 15, 2020](http://decadence-anime.com/news.html), it was announced that Kashitaro would make an appearance in the anime [Deca-Dence](https://anilist.co/anime/110353/DecaDence/) performing the ending theme titled \"[Kioku no Hakobune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-njWsJZuadU)\". This would be his first appearance in anime as a solo artist, having already appeared in shows like [Black Clover](https://anilist.co/anime/97940/Black-Clover/), [God Eater](https://anilist.co/anime/110344/God-Eater-Reso-Nantoka-Gekijou/) and [Twin Star Exorcists](https://anilist.co/anime/21499/Sousei-no-Onmyouji/) alongside [Ryou Miyata](https://anilist.co/staff/180920) as a part of the unit [ITOWOKASHI](https://anilist.co/staff/132975/Itowokashi). He made a comment alongside the news regarding the song and his appearance, stating that during the production of the song he received a storyboard that he carefully read through, which contributed to his overall feel for the show, its characters, the development and its story, this helped him when writing the lyrics and setting the tone of the song.\n\n__Trivia:__\nHeight: 180.5 cm\nFavorite Manga: [Yuu☆Yuu☆Hakusho](https://anilist.co/manga/30053/YuuYuuHakusho/), [3-gatsu no Lion](https://anilist.co/manga/31224/3gatsu-no-Lion/)\nFavorite Guitar: Gibson J-45\n\n(Sources: [Wikipedia (JP)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BC%8A%E6%9D%B1%E6%AD%8C%E8%A9%9E%E5%A4%AA%E9%83%8E), edited | [Deca-Dence's Official Website](http://decadence-anime.com/news.html), edited)\n\n",

He is known as a musician who uses a fox mask as his trademark, and he is personally under the record label Izanagi Record (2017–), having previously been under record label TOY'S FACTORY (2014–2016).\n\n__Biography:__\nHe has been active as a musician since 2011, where he would start posting covers on the platform Nico Nico Douga as an utaite. He would later in 2012 release a self-produced album titled \"my little white cat\", while making his major debut through TOY'S FACTORY in 2014.\n\nAfter releasing his second full album (which peaked 6th in the weekly Oricon ranking), to releasing a CD titled \"Hoshineko\", while also performing live at festivals, or as a one-man live under TOY'S FACTORY between 2014 to 2016, he would on October 4, 2017 release his third full album titled \"Niten Ichiryu\" while also establishing his own independent record label called \"Izanagi Record\" in 2017.\n\nHe would at the end of January 2018 undergo a surgery for his vocal cord nodules, resulting in him going on hiatus until he was able to perform again. He was allowed to talk on March 12, and would later be allowed to sing again on May 11 of the same year. During this time he wrote and published a book titled \"[Home Classroom](https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/product/321709000163/)\", which would become his debut work as a writer.\n\nFrom August 31, 2019 to October 20, 2019, he went on a one-man live tour around Japan. Later from November 2, 2019 to November 17, 2019, he went on another one-man live tour around Japan as an extension to the previous one. And from December 7, 2019 to December 8, 2019, he went on a one-man live tour that was held in Chengdu and Guangzhou in China.\n\nOn [May 15, 2020](http://decadence-anime.com/news.html), it was announced that Kashitaro would make an appearance in the anime [Deca-Dence](https://anilist.co/anime/110353/DecaDence/) performing the ending theme titled \"[Kioku no Hakobune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-njWsJZuadU)\". This would be his first appearance in anime as a solo artist, having already appeared in shows like [Black Clover](https://anilist.co/anime/97940/Black-Clover/), [God Eater](https://anilist.co/anime/110344/God-Eater-Reso-Nantoka-Gekijou/) and [Twin Star Exorcists](https://anilist.co/anime/21499/Sousei-no-Onmyouji/) alongside [Ryou Miyata](https://anilist.co/staff/180920) as a part of the unit [ITOWOKASHI](https://anilist.co/staff/132975/Itowokashi). He made a comment alongside the news regarding the song and his appearance, stating that during the production of the song he received a storyboard that he carefully read through, which contributed to his overall feel for the show, its characters, the development and its story, this helped him when writing the lyrics and setting the tone of the song.\n\n__Trivia:__\nHeight: 180.5 cm\nFavorite Manga: [Yuu☆Yuu☆Hakusho](https://anilist.co/manga/30053/YuuYuuHakusho/), [3-gatsu no Lion](https://anilist.co/manga/31224/3gatsu-no-Lion/)\nFavorite Guitar: Gibson J-45\n\n(Sources: [Wikipedia (JP)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BC%8A%E6%9D%B1%E6%AD%8C%E8%A9%9E%E5%A4%AA%E9%83%8E), edited | [Deca-Dence's Official Website](http://decadence-anime.com/news.html), edited)\n\n",
