He is better known as a utaite with a middle-high range voice.\n\n__Biography:__\nAs a utaite he likes to add effects to his voice and scream loudly in his covers. He has a very wide vocal range and a versatile voice, having the ability to hit and leap into high notes effortlessly, sometimes to feminine range, without sounding strained or loosing the softness in his voice. However, he also sounds pleasant when he sings songs in his regular and lower voice, which can sound relaxing and quite soothing. On some of his covers, many people are often confused and argue about his gender when he utilizes his higher register, therefore making him a ryouserui. Because of his high vocal range, he is also capable of producing a very convincing female voice, most clearly seen in his cover of Matryoshka. He often makes use of his wide range in his covers by leaping into higher or lower octaves to match the tone of the song.\n\nOccasionally he forgets some of the lyrics and either mumbles or makes cute noises until the next line. His songs are often tagged as someone with a \"kakuseirui\", also known as an energizing voice.",

The guitarist [Oji](https://anilist.co/staff/148135) (Kaizoku Ou), the illustrators Rocoru (in 2013) and [Mogelatte](https://anilist.co/staff/121589/Mogelatte), the video producer Ziro and the pianist [cake](https://anilist.co/staff/147555) (the latter three joining in May 2014) are also part of the group as support members. Later on they acquired the drummer Nakanishi in 2017. However, Rocoru graduated from the group in 2019.\n\nSome of their most popular songs include \"Suki Kirai\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\" and \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\". Their music style consists mostly of positive rocky songs.\n\nIn January 2014 they had their first major debut, with the album \"<i>Zutto Maekara Suki Deshita</i>.\", which ranked in fourth place on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon\">Oricon</a>. In May 2014, the start-up of \"<i>CHiCO with HoneyWorks</i>\" was announced. Sometime in early 2019, the circle began to include subunits: s×c, a duo comprised of shito and cake; and HoneyMonster, comprised of Gom (Kouto), cake, and Nakanishi. The circle also created a number of fictional idols, such as LIP×LIP and Dolce.\n\nIn addition, ten light novels, based on the <a href=\"https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Confession_Executive_Committee_Love_Series\">Confession Executive Committee Love Series</a> songs \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\", \"Yakimochi no Kotae\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\", \"Ima ni Suki Naru.\", \"Koi-Iro ni Sake\", \"Kinyoubi no Ohayou\", \"Heart no Shuchou\", \"Ijiwaru na Deai\", \"Boku ga Namae wo Yobu Hi\", and \"Daikirai na Hazu Datta.\" have been released so far. A short novella about the song \"Watashi, Idol Sengen\" was also included with a CHiCO with Honeyworks album. Light novels for HoneyWorks' other songs do exist as well; the Love and Hate Trilogy (\"Nakimushi Kareshi\", \"Suki-Kirai\", \"Hajimari no Sayonara\") and \"Sekai wa Koi ni Ochiteiru\" and its sequel \"Koi no Chord\" both received one.",

The guitarist [Oji](https://anilist.co/staff/148135) (Kaizoku Ou), the illustrators Rocoru (in 2013) and [Mogelatte](https://anilist.co/staff/121589/Mogelatte), the video producer Ziro and the pianist [cake](https://anilist.co/staff/147555) (the latter three joining in May 2014) are also part of the group as support members. Later on they acquired the drummer Nakanishi in 2017. However, Rocoru graduated from the group in 2019.\n\nSome of their most popular songs include \"Suki Kirai\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\" and \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\". Their music style consists mostly of positive rocky songs.\n\nIn January 2014 they had their first major debut, with the album \"<i>Zutto Maekara Suki Deshita</i>.\", which ranked in fourth place on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon\">Oricon</a>. In May 2014, the start-up of \"<i>CHiCO with HoneyWorks</i>\" was announced. Sometime in early 2019, the circle began to include subunits: s×c, a duo comprised of shito and cake; and HoneyMonster, comprised of Gom (Kouto), cake, and Nakanishi. The circle also created a number of fictional idols, such as LIP×LIP and Dolce.\n\nIn addition, ten light novels, based on the <a href=\"https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Confession_Executive_Committee_Love_Series\">Confession Executive Committee Love Series</a> songs \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\", \"Yakimochi no Kotae\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\", \"Ima ni Suki Naru.\", \"Koi-Iro ni Sake\", \"Kinyoubi no Ohayou\", \"Heart no Shuchou\", \"Ijiwaru na Deai\", \"Boku ga Namae wo Yobu Hi\", and \"Daikirai na Hazu Datta.\" have been released so far.
