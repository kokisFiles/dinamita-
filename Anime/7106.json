  "description": "When a young boy called Hiro finds what appears to be a broken lighter in an empty field, it changes his life forever. This lighter is actually the Gold Lightan, a robot that fell to Earth from the Robot Dimension. When called upon to defend the Earth from Ivalda the Great's evil robots, Gold Lightan transforms into a giant super robot, known as the Golden Warrior. Gold Lightan joins forces with Hiro's and his gang, the One Pack Rangers to protect the Earth from the evil schemes of Ivalda the Great and his armored forces.",

Recurring themes and aesthetics in his works include oppressive police states, unsuccessful protest movements, dysfunctional bureaucracies, political action that results in stasis, biblical scripture, and imagery, philosophical dilemmas, characters trapped in seemingly inescapable situations, the use of dialog as descriptive \"texture\" rather than a plot-driver, and otherwise Euro-arthouse pacing and storyboarding. He is both polarizing to mainstream audiences, and highly revered by cinephiles and Hollywood directors; his works have influenced Hollywood films such as Dark City, The Matrix, and Avatar.\n\n[Kenji Kamiyama](https://anilist.co/staff/100348/), an anime director also closely associated with [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), is his protégé.",

Mashimo studied jurisprudence at Sophia University and during his fourth university year, he participated in the making of several television commercials.

Some time after that, he founded a small freelance studio called Mashimo Jimusho that was mainly producing in-between animation for larger companies. In 1997, Mashimo presented his studio-as-hospital concept to Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, the president of Production I.G, who was so impressed with it that he immediately agreed to sponsor Mashimo.

During this time she met [Yuuji Nunokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/117781/), who then invited her to join the establishment of [Studio Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/) in 1978.\n\nAt Pierrot she worked as an in-betweener on [Nils no Fushigi no Tabi](https://anilist.co/anime/2151/), the studio’s first show. After this she went freelance and soon gave up on her talent as an animator and turned into directing. She asked for guidance from [Kouichi Mashimo](https://anilist.co/staff/100094/), and made her debut as one of the two episode directors on the 29th episode of [Gold Lightan](https://anilist.co/anime/7106/) in 1981.\n\nShe continued her work storyboarding and directing episodes on shows such as [Dash Kappei](https://anilist.co/anime/2748/), [Miyuki](https://anilist.co/anime/2231/) and [Glass no Kamen](https://anilist.co/anime/506/). After this she made her series director debut with [Touch](https://anilist.co/anime/1065/) in 1985, a role which she was hand-picked for by [Gisaburou Sugii](https://anilist.co/staff/103537/), who served as the show’s chief director. They both reprised their roles for [Hiatari Ryoukou!](https://anilist.co/anime/729/) which took over the TV slot for Touch. After this Tokita directed [Yawara!](https://anilist.co/anime/691/), instead this time without an overseeing director.\n\nAfter having directed several more titles in the ‘90s, she switched her focus entirely to scriptwriting. As a writer she most famously worked on shows like [Tsukihime](https://anilist.co/anime/169/) and [School Rumble](https://anilist.co/anime/24/) before leaving the industry in 2009.",

Also a current advisor for [Satelight](https://anilist.co/studio/41/).\n\nFamous for his work in the [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) and Transformers franchises. He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",
