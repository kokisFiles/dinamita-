He made his initial splash in [Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket](https://anilist.co/anime/82/), and continued to develop his approach to animation which he calls \"full limited,\" which eliminated the pose-to-pose feel of conventional keyframe animation. His characteristic animation can be seen in [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) and [End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/).\n\nIn [Blood: The Last Vampire](https://anilist.co/anime/405/), Iso experimented with digital processing of his hand-drawn fire effects, elevating it to uncanny realism. Iso then got his first taste of directing in [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/) episode 15, which he largely animated and also digitally processed himself.\n\nHis animation sensibilities, process innovations, experience in multiple levels of anime production, and interest in technology culminated in the 2007 sci-fi series, [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/), his veritable brainchild. During its production, there was a rumored falling-out with key staff. For the next several years, Iso would quietly animate under the pseudonym Mikio Odagawa.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2018, he announced his retirement as an animator to focus exclusively on directing.",

His animation style includes using exaggerating motion, manipulating gravity and balance with use of different perspective shots, lots of rapid camera movement and unconventional angles. With his boldly distorted and vigorous drawing style, his cuts are unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nHe has worked as an animator for over thirty years. His early work in the 80's mainly consisted of action and effects cuts. He bounced around several studios, including [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and [Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/). His early cuts include [Gall Force 2: Destruction](https://anilist.co/anime/2061/), for which he animated a laser beam with a distinctly loose and vivid sense of movement. With its smooth animation and wavy motion pattern, the cut has a lively fluidity to it that can be seen as the first step towards Oohira's current distinctive visuality. He used the same approach on his smoke effects for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and a flood for [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/). His style truly came into fruition when he started applying this to solid objects – especially people. The earliest such case is his cut in the fourth episode in [The Hakkenden: Shin Shou](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/). The Oohira \"wobble,\" is perhaps his most distinct trademark: the animated objects expand and compress in a wobbling manner.\n\nAspired to become an animator after having seen [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/)'s work on [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/).\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\n",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/松本憲生)\n\nOriginating from Tatsunoko's animators training institute, where he met [Atsushi Wakabayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/105805/). Though primarily an action animator, he’s demonstrated impressive range elsewhere like in his scenes for [Haibane Renmei](https://anilist.co/anime/387/) and [Kaguya-hime](https://anilist.co/anime/16664/). He has the reputation of a fast and disciplined worker. [Toshiyuki Inoue](https://anilist.co/staff/103724/) said that he must have a “secret” for producing such a large volume of superb cuts.\n\nThough one of his earliest assignments was as an in-betweens checker for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/), his first major job was on [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), working under the director of the series, [Kazuhiro Furuhashi](https://anilist.co/staff/100655/). He would collaborate with Furuhashi again on Rurouni Kenshin, [You’re Under Arrest](https://anilist.co/anime/1577/), and [Hunter x Hunter](https://anilist.co/anime/136/). Around this time Matsumoto was also mentored by [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on [Irresponsible Captain Tylor](https://anilist.co/anime/569/).\n\nMatsumoto’s character animation is loose and full of smears, often looking like featureless masses in individual frames. He draws smoke without highlights, a tendency that earned the nickname “Norio smoke” and has been imitated by animators like [Shingo Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/114914/) and [Kenichi Kutsuna](https://anilist.co/staff/116007/). He occasionally storyboards his own scenes as he did for the 12th episode of [Birdy Decode:02](https://anilist.co/anime/5074/), the [third Naruto movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2144/), and episodes 31 & 85 of [Rurouni Kenshin](https://anilist.co/anime/45/). Prefers battles that take place in wide-open spaces with lots of forward momentum and background movement. Influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) and [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/), and has adapted elements of their approach for a wider audience.\n\nWhenever he serves as animation director on an episode, he does a lot of the key animation work himself. He also soloed the 7th episode of [Eat-Man](https://anilist.co/anime/1704/) and the [Kuragehime](https://anilist.co/anime/8129/) ED. He failed attempting to solo the 39th episode of You’re Under Arrest, and requested his name not be on the telop despite animating the vast majority of the episode.\n\nFamous for his work on the [Naruto](https://anilist.co/anime/20/) franchise, in which he often collaborated with Atsushi Wakabayashi.\n\nAs a well known animator with a wide network of connections, he regularly helps and receives help from his friends.\n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",

Studied under [Moriyasu Taniguchi](https://anilist.co/staff/106638/).\n\nAmong the most technically adept of the realist movement, Okiura’s animation pushes photorealism to the limit. His scenes being so lifelike that they’re often confused for rotoscoping. He draws characters with realistic proportions and weighty movement, and is a perfectionist in the minor details. He’s particularly skilled with busy crowd shots.\n\nMarried to voice actress [Sumi Mutou](https://anilist.co/staff/96118/).",

In 1981, when she was in her third university year, she learned that Toei Douga was recruiting new employees and took an exam to become a trainee director. The studio's policy at the time was not to employ women as directors, and although she scored top marks in the exam, she was encouraged to try writing screenplays instead. She made her debut with a script for episode 42 of Dr. Slump: Arale-chan, which was aired on 10 February 1982. After that, she established a successful career in scriptwriting. On 15 December 2017, she passed away at age 58 from an undisclosed disease.\n",
