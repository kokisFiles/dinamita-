          "description": "**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/cunepero)**\n\nKojima got started in the industry one day while he was working as a freelancer in various industries and somehow ended up with a job in anime at the age of 23.\n\nHis first project was on the show \"[Shima Shima Tora no Shimajirou](https://anilist.co/anime/9768/Shima-Shima-Tora-no-Shimajirou/)\" under [Studio Kikan](https://anilist.co/studio/256/Studio-Kikan), where he got started of by doing in-between animation. At the time he was very unexperienced with anime production and has [said](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he likely would have been fired for his lack of knowledge and poor quality work, if not for the in-between animation checker teaching him everything from scratch.\n\nLater down the line after establishing himself more in the anime industry, he would go on to work on \"[Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/Tengen-Toppa-Gurren-Lagann/)\" as a challenge to himself, where he would put forth mecha and effects animation he had no idea how to prior.\n\nKojima [states](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he feels a lot of inspiration from manga artists who are able to think about a story, break it up into panels, and express it in pictures. He has thought about drawing a manga himself, even if it's something simple.\n\nSome of his favorite anime are \"[Inital D](https://anilist.co/anime/185/Initial-D/),\" \"[Natsume's Book of Friends](https://anilist.co/anime/4081/Natsume-Yuujinchou/),\" \"[Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-](https://anilist.co/anime/21355/ReZero-kara-Hajimeru-Isekai-Seikatsu/),\" \"[Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Shin-Seiki-Evangelion/),\" \"[A KITE](https://anilist.co/anime/320/A-KITE/),\" \"[JIN-ROH](https://anilist.co/anime/570/JINROH/),\" \"[FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/)\" and \"[Doukyuusei -Classmates-](https://anilist.co/anime/21096/Doukyuusei/).\"\n\nSome of his favorite manga are \"[HI Score Girl](https://anilist.co/manga/74501/Hi-Score-Girl/)\" and \"[A White Rose in Bloom](https://anilist.co/manga/108360/Mejirobana-no-Saku/).\"\n",

He has been affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/) since its establishment.\n\nBorn in Tokyo and raised in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, he discovered his passion for anime during middle school, inspired by classics like [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/Galaxy-Express-999/) and [Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/). It was in high school that he met a like-minded friend with a love for drawing, sparking his aspiration to become an animator. During those formative years, he actively participated in the art club, where he honed his skills and embarked on creating independent anime projects.\n\nAfter graduating from the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he joined Studio Wombat as an in-between animator. During his time at the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he shared the same class with notable contemporaries such as [Mitsuru Obunai](https://anilist.co/staff/103077/Mitsuru-Obunai), [Yutaka Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/101801/Yutaka-Nakamura), and [Junichi Fujisaku](https://anilist.co/staff/100423/Junichi-Fujisaku). His journey took a significant turn in 1999 when he played a pivotal role in the establishment of [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/ufotable). Gathering with visionaries like [Hikaru Kondou](https://anilist.co/staff/103076/Hikaru-Kondou) in an old apartment in North Ikebukuro, Tokyo, they laid the foundation for what would become a renowned animation studio. In 2009, he made a significant move to the newly opened ufotable Tokushima Studio, where he assumed a leadership role, overseeing and nurturing a team primarily composed of young talents.\n\nOriginally harboring aspirations of becoming a director, he navigated a path from being an animator to realizing his dream. Armed with experiences in key animation and directing, he marked his directorial debut with \"Hanaukyo Maid Team: La Verite.\" Following his move to ufotable Tokushima Studio, he assumed the position of chief of the directing department, leaving his mark on numerous episodes. In his directorial role, he approached each project with careful consideration, assigning cuts to the Tokushima Studio staff thoughtfully, illustrating his dedication and meticulous approach to his craft.",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/野中卓也)\n\nOriginating from Studio Wombat. He has been affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/) since its establishment.\n\nBorn in Tokyo and raised in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, he discovered his passion for anime during middle school, inspired by classics like [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/Galaxy-Express-999/) and [Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/). It was in high school that he met a like-minded friend with a love for drawing, sparking his aspiration to become an animator. During those formative years, he actively participated in the art club, where he honed his skills and embarked on creating independent anime projects.\n\nAfter graduating from the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he joined Studio Wombat as an in-between animator. During his time at the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he shared the same class with notable contemporaries such as [Mitsuru Obunai](https://anilist.co/staff/103077/Mitsuru-Obunai), [Yutaka Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/101801/Yutaka-Nakamura), and [Junichi Fujisaku](https://anilist.co/staff/100423/Junichi-Fujisaku). His journey took a significant turn in 1999 when he played a pivotal role in the establishment of [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/ufotable). Gathering with visionaries like [Hikaru Kondou](https://anilist.co/staff/103076/Hikaru-Kondou) in an old apartment in North Ikebukuro, Tokyo, they laid the foundation for what would become a renowned animation studio. In 2009, he made a significant move to the newly opened ufotable Tokushima Studio, where he assumed a leadership role, overseeing and nurturing a team primarily composed of young talents.\n\nOriginally harboring aspirations of becoming a director, he navigated a path from being an animator to realizing his dream. Armed with experiences in key animation and directing, he marked his directorial debut with \"Hanaukyo Maid Team: La Verite.\" Following his move to ufotable Tokushima Studio, he assumed the position of chief of the directing department, leaving his mark on numerous episodes. In his directorial role, he approached each project with careful consideration, assigning cuts to the Tokushima Studio staff thoughtfully, illustrating his dedication and meticulous approach to his craft.",
