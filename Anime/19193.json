          "description": "Nishio graduated from Nagoya Designer Academy and started his career at Anime Spot, a subcontracting studio, after being refused in interviews with several animation studios. He debuted as an in-betweener on [Osomatsu-kun](https://anilist.co/anime/9883/) and as a key animator on [Laughing Salesman](https://anilist.co/anime/3077/).\n\nIt's on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392//) that Nishio came into his own as an animator, developing weighty and realistic movements influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). Thanks to the ability demonstrated there, he was chosen to design the characters for [Ninku](https://anilist.co/anime/912/).\n\nAfter working as character designer and chief animation director on [Jin-Roh](https://anilist.co/anime/570/) he permanently joined Production I.G. where he became known, together with [Hiroyuki Okiura](https://anilist.co/staff/103502/) and [Kazuchika Kise](https://anilist.co/staff/115781/), as \"The Three Gods of I.G.\"\n\n[Masashi Kishimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96879/) requested for Nishio to be the character designer of the Naruto anime.\n\nIn August 2020, he was promoted to company director of Production I.G alongside [Takayuki Gotou](https://anilist.co/staff/103266/Takayuki-Gotou/), a co-founder of the studio.",

          "description": "Shirow studied oil painting at Osaka University of Arts. While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, Black Magic, which was published in the manga dōjinshi Atlas. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.\n\nThe result was best-selling manga Appleseed, a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of Black Magic and a second volume of Appleseed, he released Dominion in 1986. Two more volumes of Appleseed followed before he began work on Ghost in the Shell.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated again with Production I.G to co-create the original concept for the anime television series Shinreigari/Ghost Hound, Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with Production I.G began airing in April 2008, titled Real Drive.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
