They are under their own independent music label named TUYU (2020–).\n\n__Biography:__\nPusu, a vocalist and music producer who had recently resigned as a vocalist, would go on to [tweet](https://twitter.com/Pusu_kun/status/1138416098997460993) on June 11, 2019 that he was working on a new original song in addition to working on \"new things\".\n\nA day later, it was revealed through a tweet by Pusu, which linked to a YouTube video on his now rebranded channel, that the original song he had been working on wasn't a solo project, and that it was titled \"TUYU - やっぱり雨は降るんだね\", indicating that the \"new things\" might be a new band. On the same day, about 35 minutes later, a [tweet](https://twitter.com/TUYU_official/status/1138771878766448641) by a new twitter account named TUYU_official was retweeted by Pusu, which officially announced the formation of the music unit Tuyu.\n\nTheir first upload as a band was the song _Yappari Ame wa Furunda ne_, which was uploaded on June 12, 2019, with the same name being used for their first album released later on February 19, 2020. All of their music videos up until _[Kako ni Torawarete Iru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGFEqEFJ410)_, have been animated by AzyuN, featuring art by Omutatsu.\n\nOn May 31, 2024, composer Pusu was arrested in Tokyo after an attempted murder of his girlfriend. This led to the disbandment of the group, announced on June 8, 2024 via a [tweet](https://x.com/TUYU_official/status/1799380850414330008).\n\n__Members:__\n- [Pusu](https://anilist.co/staff/186915) (ぷす) – guitarist and in-charge of lyrics and composition\n\n__Former Members:__\n- [Rei](https://anilist.co/staff/186920/Rei) (礼衣) – vocalist\n- AzyuN – animator and illustrator\n- [miro](https://anilist.co/staff/186918/Miro) – pianist\n- [Omutatsu](https://anilist.co/staff/148987/Koto-Tatsui) (おむたつ), also known as Koto Tatsui (たついこと) – illustrator and designer",

His debut work titled _Heisei Cataclysm_, which features the vocaloid IA, was first uploaded on December 26, 2012 to Nico Nico Douga and YouTube. The song was a part of a project titled the \"[Heisei Project](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Heisei_Project)\", which was a series of songs made and produced by Pusu himself alongside a few others.\n\nPusu alongside his team would go on to produce 12 songs related to the Heisei Project between 2012 and 2019, with the last being uploaded on April 30, 2019. Two of the songs in the project are technically album exclusives, and thus not canon in the series, so officially there are 10 songs in the series.

He is a former vocalist, and best known as the music producer behind the 2012 vocaloid song _[Heisei Cataclysm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K1-Th1aJzI&t=1s)_.\n\n__Biography:__\nPusu, or better known as Zips, started back in 2012 as a vocaloid music producer. His debut work titled _Heisei Cataclysm_, which features the vocaloid IA, was first uploaded on December 26, 2012 to Nico Nico Douga and YouTube. The song was a part of a project titled the \"[Heisei Project](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Heisei_Project)\", which was a series of songs made and produced by Pusu himself alongside a few others.\n\nPusu alongside his team would go on to produce 12 songs related to the Heisei Project between 2012 and 2019, with the last being uploaded on April 30, 2019. Two of the songs in the project are technically album exclusives, and thus not canon in the series, so officially there are 10 songs in the series. In their last upload, Pusu under the name Zips, bids farewell to what he calls the \"Heisei Era\" and thanks the series for what it did to his career as a music producer.\n\nDuring his \"Heisei Era\", around early-2015, Pusu would expand on his career as a vocaloid producer, where he would start performing in his own-self produced songs alongside other prominent utaite, or by himself. This would go on until around mid-2019, where he would [tweet](https://twitter.com/Pusu_kun/status/1130808604116709376) out on May 21, 2019, that he would formally resign as a singer after his last performance in the song <i>[Gekokujou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-fuUVrXO_Q)</i>, which was uploaded on May 23, 2019.\n\nFollowing Pusu's last upload on May 23, he would go on to [tweet](https://twitter.com/Pusu_kun/status/1138416098997460993) on June 11, 2019, that he was working on a new original song in addition to working on \"new things\" as a follow-up to his last tweet regarding his resignation. A day later he would go on to [tweet](https://twitter.com/Pusu_kun/status/1138762897369100288) again, stating that his new original song had been published, and he would be happy if people would listen to it. On the the same day as he tweeted about his song, Pusu [retweeted](https://twitter.com/TUYU_official/status/1138771878766448641) a tweet from a new twitter account named TUYU_official, which announced the formation of the band Tuyu, which he would participate in.\n\n",
