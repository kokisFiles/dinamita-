He got to know manga through [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/)'s [Astro Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/). Other superheroes like Ultraman and Ultra Seven also gripped him. He has cited American pop artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol as major influences.\n\nIn a 2017 [interview](https://youtu.be/2a6Wqq4zifw), Eguchi said that the ideal woman for him in his drawings isn't one that he would dream to date, but instead one he would've wanted to become if he was born a girl.\n\nHe has also provided original character designs for [Roujin Z](https://anilist.co/anime/2000/), [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/), [Mujin Wakusei Survive](https://anilist.co/anime/709/) and [Sonny Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/132126/).\n\nIn 1990, he married the idol singer Mari Mizutani.",

          "description": "Hamasu's animation mainly focuses on character acting, and his scenes often feature minimal camerawork with a heavy emphasis on expressive facial and body animation. Much like [Kouichi Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/121208/), he was heavily influenced by [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/) and the late '80s realism. Early in his career he was employed at Toei Animation, and was thus a recurring presence in the studio's OVA works such as [Xanadu](https://anilist.co/anime/5920/), [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/anime/1153/) and [Vampire Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/1765/). His rising prominence during the early '90s allowed him to participate on [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), and from thereon he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\nIn 1993, Hamasu animated the car chase on [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)’s episode of the [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/). The scene impressed Kon enough for Hamasu to end up as a character designer and animation director on [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/). He was also set to serve a similar role in [Millennium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), but was replaced in the role by [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/) due to having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. He appeared on all of Kon’s films, as well as [Paranoia Agent](https://anilist.co/anime/323/) until the director's passing.\n\nMore recently he has mostly worked on [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) and [Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/)'s films.",

          "description": "Takamura Mukuo was a famous art director from Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan. He was a graduate of Musashino Art University, where he majored in Western Painting. After graduating in 1963, Mukuo joined Tokyo Movie Studio and started his career as a background artist for animation. In 1966, he established his own studio, Mukuo Group and Mukuo Studio in 1968, which was incorporated three years later in 1971.\n\nSome of his best known works include the feature film [Cello Hiki no Gauche](https://anilist.co/anime/1049/) and [Haha o Tazunete Sanzenri](https://anilist.co/anime/1663/), part of the WMT series, both directed by [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/). For the latter he visited actual places in Italy and Argentina together with Takahata and Miyazaki, to ensure an authentic feel to the series.\n\nHe was also known for his contribution to science-fiction anime franchises [Uchuu Senkan Yamato](https://anilist.co/anime/1650/), [Uchuu Kaizoku Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/) and [Ginga Tetsudou 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/).\n\nHe was awarded the first grand-prix of the first anime popularity contest in the category of art, which was organised by the publisher Tokuma-Shoten. The contest was won by Mukuo five times in a row, until it was cancelled, making him the only winner in the art category.\n\nMukuo had greatly contributed to the rapid development of the animation in Japan during the 1970s and 80s.\n\nHe passed away from cancer on June 9, 1992 at the age of 54.

Titled Takamura Mukuo: The Art of Animation and supervised by Keiko Mukuo and Tadao Kubota, it does include much of Mukuo's background art, image boards, and plans to masterpieces like Ginga Tetsudou 999, Haha o Tazunete Sanzenri, [Neo Tokyo](https://anilist.co/anime/1951/), Cello Hiki no Gauche, Sailor Moon and [Kamui no Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/496/).",
