He quit music school as an elementary school student and, until his high school years, studied under Iwashita Tetsuya, who taught him how to use multiple recordings and synthesizers. He became a composer in his later high school years, through the various efforts made by himself and his teacher.\n\nIn 1985, he won a prize at the Kanagawa Arts Festival choral composition competition, while in the late 1980s, after entering Tokyo University of the Arts, he studied contemporary music under Satou Shin and Aoshima Hiroshi. While still being a student, he received the New Artist Award from the Japan Contemporary Music Association. He later started working as an arranger after graduating from college.\n\nIn 1999, he participated in the music unit \"Smart Drug\" with Koizumi Hiroshi, who was responsible for doing the composition and playing the guitar, and Okamoto Sayori who would later rename to Hiyoko, who was responsible for doing the lyrics and vocals. He participated under the alias \"Taque,\" where he was responsible for the arrangement and playing the keyboard. They released three CDs from 1999 to 2002.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

However, the sound has changed in recent times to take on a darker and more mysterious tone. Takarano Arika, lead singer/lyricist, has termed this change as a transition from White Alice (白アリ) to Black Alice (黒アリ). Though there has been a general shift towards performing songs in the \"Black Alice\" phase, Ali Project has occasionally sung in the White Alice style as well.\n \nIn 1988 they made their indie debut in the chartsas Ari (Ant) Project (蟻プロジェクト) with their album Fantastic Garden (幻想庭園 Gensou Teien). The album was later included in Tatsumi Takayuki's book Philosophy of Progressive Rock (プログレッシヴ・ロックの哲学), which led to the band being classified under the progressive rock genre. Four years later in 1992 they changed their name and made their major debut with their single \"Fall in love, maiden\" (恋せよ乙女 Koi-seyo otome).\n\nMost of their records are released by Toshiba-EMI, Victor Entertainment and Tokuma Japan. The band is notable in the anime community for having their songs featured in several anime opening and ending sequences, most notably the series Noir and Rozen Maiden.\n\n<b>Members</b>\n- [Arika Takarano](https://anilist.co/staff/101307/Arika-Takarano) (宝野アリカ) - vocals, lyrics\n- [Mikiya Katakura](https://anilist.co/staff/101309/Mikiya-Katakura) (片倉三起也) - music, arrangement\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
