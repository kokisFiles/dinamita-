He is also responsible for the concept and character design for the series [NieA_7](https://anilist.co/anime/800/). He is the creator of the doujinshi Haibane Renmei, which was also adapted into [an anime](https://anilist.co/anime/387/).\n\nHe first began his career as a teen in Tokyo, being initially recognized as a graffiti artist who regularly got into legal problems with his art. His concepts for all his later works are said to be inspired by this time of his life and has projected a dark theme into his anime character designs. He is also a colleague and friend of [Chiaki J. Konaka](https://anilist.co/staff/101160/), with whom he collaborated on both Serial Experiments Lain and [Texhnolyze](https://anilist.co/anime/26/).\n\nEndorses \"ABe\" as romaji spelling of his surname.",

Konaka is a Japanese writer and scenarist best known for shows such as [Serial Experiments Lain](https://anilist.co/anime/339/), [Digimon Tamers](https://anilist.co/anime/874/) and [Texhnolyze](https://anilist.co/anime/26/). He is also known to be the creator of Ultraman Gaia, as cited by Tsuburaya Productions.\n\nKonaka's serious works generally have a dark, psychological tone. As a Cthulhu Mythos writer, he tends to add Lovecraftian elements to his works.\n\n\"Chiaki J. Konaka\" is a very unusual name, as Japanese names typically do not include middle names. Konaka states that the \"J.\" evokes the \"Christian\" name \"John\", due to him being born to parents who were members of the Anglican Church, but he does not identify as Christian. He began using the \"J.\" at the age of 12, when he began making 8 mm films; he patterned the style after Western names such as \"Charles M. Schulz\".\n\nHe has cited [Ghost Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/2596/) as his favorite screenwriting project.",
