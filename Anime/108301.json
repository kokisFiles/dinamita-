At the age of 20, Kensuke first came in contact with the electronic music world known as techno. \n\nIn 2007, he would start his solo career under the stage name agraph, this is when he started to create his own electronic music. His debut album titled A Day, Phases, produced by Takkyu Ishino, was released in December of 2008. Skipping to 2010, he would release his second album titled Equal which managed to rank in the Japanese Albums Charts.\n\nIn 2011, Kensuke and former musicians from the bands Supercar and Number Girl formed a rock band called Lama. The band has released two albums, which both managed to rank in the official Albums Charts of Japan.  It was later revealed that due to his involvement in the rock band Lama, he wouldn't be able to release a third album until 6 years after his second album. His third album titled The Shader was released in 2016.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
