  "description": "The Imperial Seal has been passed down through the generations since ancient times. It confers great power unto the warriors that it chooses. This is the story of those warriors.<br>\nIt is a time of chaos and of civil war. It is a time when great armies clash in titanic battles and great heroes carve their names in history. It is also a time of death and destruction, when the people of the land live in constant fear of the sword. Onto this stage steps the reluctant Rikuson (Lu Xun), whose family had been the guardians of the Imperial Seal up until it was stolen by Sonsaku. At the behest of his mentor Rikuson offers his services to Sonsaku with the intention of confirming the will of the Imperial Seal. However, assassins strike down Sonsaku and the Imperial Seal is lost. So begins, Rikuson&rsquo;s journey to recover the Imperial Seal and discover his destiny. <br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

After entering high school, due to the uncertainty he felt towards the future, Miyano started attending singing and dance lessons he has been skipping until now. While taking music lessons, Miyano started to discover his music style through the encounter with music produced by singers like CHEMISTRY and EXILE. Miyano's first acting job was in 1992 in Tokusou Exceedraft, where he appeared in a flashback as a child in a yakuza member's past.\n\nIn 2001, he had his voice acting debut in a live action teen drama Caitlin's Way.\n\nIn 2002, he voiced Riku in the Japanese version for the video game Kingdom Hearts. Miyano also had his first anime voice acting role the same year, voicing Akira in [Shin Megami Tensei Devil Children: Light & Dark](https://anilist.co/anime/4068/). In 2003, he voiced [Kiba](https://anilist.co/character/241/), the main character in [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/). A few years later in 2006, he had what most would call his breakout role in [Death Note](https://anilist.co/anime/1535/) where he voiced the main character [Light Yagami](https://anilist.co/character/80/). For his role as Light, he was nominated for two awards at the first ever Seiyuu Awards in March 2007.\n\nOn May 28, 2007, on the King Records label, Miyano debuted as a singer with the single \"Kuon.\" The single debuted at number 47 on the Oricon charts and was used as the ending theme song for anime series [Koutetsu Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/2162/). On June 13, he released a collaboration single titled \"Fight,\" with fellow voice actress [Romi Park](https://anilist.co/staff/95082/). The duo's single debuted on the Oricon chart at number 73.\n\nIn 2008, at the second Seiyuu Awards, Miyano won \"Best Actor in a Leading Role\" for his roles [Setsuna F. Seiei](https://anilist.co/character/4234/) and [Rikuson Hakugen](https://anilist.co/character/2844/), from [Mobile Suit Gundam 00](https://anilist.co/anime/2581/) and [Koutetsu Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/2162/) respectively. Miyano also married later that same year and he and his wife have a son together.\n\n__Non-anime voice roles:__\n- Riku - *Kingdom Hearts* series (VG)\n- Ignis Scientia - *Final Fantasy XV* (2016 VG)\n- Peter B.
