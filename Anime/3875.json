          "description": "[Official Website](https://yokoyama-mitsuteru.com/)\n\nMitsuteru Yokoyama was a Japanese manga artist born in Suma Ward of Kobe City in Hyōgo Prefecture.\nYokoyama spent his boyhood during World War II and was evacuated to Tottori with his family. He graduated from Kobe municipal Ota junior high school and went on to the Kobe municipal Suma high school. [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/Osamu-Tezuka)'s \"Metropolis\" made a deep impression on Yokoyama who wished to become a manga artist in earnest and so he contributed his works to a comic book in his high school days.\nYokoyama came out with the book \"Otonashi no Ken (音無しの剣 Sword without sound)\" for his manga artist début, which caught [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/Osamu-Tezuka)'s attention.\nCreated the very first \"Giant Robot\" series, Tetsujin 28 (Gigantor) in 1956. Also created the first \"Magical Girl\" series, Sally the Witch, in 1966.\n\nDied from a house fire in 2004, aged 69.",

At that time she credited herself with her real name but switched to the current variant shortly after.\n\nMost of her work revolves around shoujo shows, such as Mahou Tsukai Sally and Kodocha. Her debut as series composer was on the second season of Shounen Ashibe in 1992. She often works together with other female Writers Guild members, such as Reiko Yoshida and Mamiko Ikeda.",
