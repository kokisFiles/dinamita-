She has one elder and one younger sister and one brother. She hates to lose (in every point of view) and she loves the Margaret Magazine of Shueisha. She says that she is too fat and that she dislikes her face. She has two cats named Riku and Kai, and at Tanemura's homepage you can find many photos of them. She wants to draw like no-one else (she can't lose...) and she loves to go to karaoke with her assistants (friends). She is good friends with the manga-ka [Ryo Maekawa](https://anilist.co/staff/98904/Ryo-Maekawa) and [Ruka Kazuki](https://anilist.co/staff/100291/Ruka-Kazuki).\n\nShe's not really a fan of yaoi (boys' love) manga, but she has made a yaoi doujinshi (no specified title) for one of her friends. She has also made a few adults-only comics on Full Moon wo Sagashite and Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne.\n\nHer nicknames include the sobriquets \"Arinacchi\" and \"Arinaccho\" (Arinaccho is a humorous play on Arinacchi, and was said just because of the ridiculousness of it all).\n\nArina participated in Shinshi Doumei Cross drama CDs as [Yoshitaka Ichinomiya](https://anilist.co/character/3507/Yoshitaka-Ichinomiya) and Postman.",

Married to [Momoko Kamiya](https://anilist.co/staff/250361).\n\nUpon enrolling at Osaka University of Arts, Yuuichi Terao, alongside [Takashi Suhara](https://anilist.co/staff/146678/Takashi-Suhara) and others, embarked on the autonomous creation of animated films, even organizing screenings through university circles in the Kanto region. After joining animation production company ufotable in December 2003, Terao, initially aspiring for the production department as a production manager but he was assigned to the newly formed photography department (now the Digital Imaging Department) due to presenting visual materials during his interview. Despite lacking prior photography expertise, he learned from scratch, commencing his career as a compositor. From 2007 onwards, Terao transitioned to the role of \"Director of Photography\" in notable works such as \"The Garden of Sinners.\" Presently serving as Chief of ufotable's Digital Imaging Department, he oversees photography and CG, contributing significantly to ufotable's works. Beyond photography and CG, Terao actively engages in various roles, including animation, background sections, directing, and storyboarding, even participating in the early stages of background art creation. Noteworthy for his involvement in promotional videos and commercials, Terao gained attention for creating faction-specific commercials for the TV anime [Fate/Zero](https://anilist.co/anime/10087/FateZero/) in 2011. \n\nHis directorial contributions extend to ufotable works' opening sequences and game animations, with a notable debut as a storyboard artist and director in the final episode of the 2019 TV anime [Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/). Terao's multifaceted contributions align with his belief in animation as a collective art form, emphasizing teamwork in production. \n\nRecognized for his expertise in integrating 3DCG seamlessly with characters and background art, Terao's artistic approach aims for high-quality animation. His \"photorealistic\" visuals, adopted since 2007, have been praised, contributing to his receipt of the Tokyo Anime Award 2022's \"Individual Award\".",
