  "description": "For young witches everywhere, the world-renowned witch Shiny Chariot reigns as the most revered and celebrated role model. But as the girls age, so do their opinions of her—now just the mention of Chariot would get a witch labeled a child. However, undeterred in her blind admiration for Chariot, ordinary girl Atsuko Kagari enrolls into Luna Nova Magical Academy, hoping to someday become just as mesmerizing as her idol.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, the witch academy isn't all the fun and games Atsuko thought it would be: boring lectures, strict teachers, and students who mock Chariot plague the campus. Coupled with her own ineptness in magic, she's seen as little more than a rebel student. But when a chance finally presents itself to prove herself to her peers and teachers, she takes it, and now it's up to her to stop a rampaging dragon before it flattens the entire academy.<br>\n<br>\nLittle Witch Academia is one of the four anime works that each received 38 million yen (about US$480,000) from the \"2012 Young Animator Training Project.\" Just like in 2010 and 2011, the animation labor group received 214.5 million yen (US$2.65 million) from the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs, and it distributed most of those funds to studios who train young animators on-the-job.<br>\n<br>\nPositive response to the movie led Studio Trigger to run a Kickstarter funding a sequel, which surpassed its funding goal.\n",

Yoshinari entered the anime industry through the influence of his older brother, [Kou Yoshinari](https://anilist.co/staff/102136/). Several of his early works were uncredited second key animation and in-betweens for his brother during high school. After leaving professional school, he applied to [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/) and [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/). Not receiving a response from Gainax, he joined Madhouse. Due to a misunderstanding, Gainax failed to process his application until three months later. Not wanting to explain, Yoshinari told Madhouse; \"being an animator is too hard for me,\" and switched to Gainax.\n\nAt Gainax, Yoshinari had joined just after the closure of [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). With nothing to do, he was immediately put onto visual development for the film [Aoki Uru](https://anilist.co/anime/21430/), although the film’s production was later broken off due to the studio’s financial state. Undoubtedly his breakout as an animator was just a few years later when he served as one of the lead animators in [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/). Yoshinari worked at Gainax until leaving for Trigger in 2011, a studio founded by fellow ex-Gainax members, [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/) and [Masahiko Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/). At Trigger he debuted as a director on [Little Witch Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/14349/).\n\nYoshinari is recognized by the way he represents volume and perspective using spheres, especially for smoke and explosions, as well as his character action in general. His characters often borrow traits from western animation, such as rectangular heads, low contrast shading, big eyes and angular lineart. He uses expertly timed smears, dramatic camerawork, and complicated background animation to convey dynamism. His movement is springy and tense, cleanly situated in the dominant cartoony style of ‘00s Gainax. He remarks [Nijitte Monogatari](https://anilist.co/manga/112385/) as one of his most important influences, with his artistic style particularly visible in his design work for [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/) and Little Witch Academia.\n\nAlso a big fan of [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/)’s, having done multiple short [animations](https://anilist.co/anime/123638/) based on his manga characters.\n\nMarried to producer [Naoko Tsutsumi](https://anilist.co/staff/150017/).\n\n(Sources: Wikipedia, Anidb, Animators Wiki)",

Yoshinari entered the anime industry through the influence of his older brother, [Kou Yoshinari](https://anilist.co/staff/102136/). Several of his early works were uncredited second key animation and in-betweens for his brother during high school. After leaving professional school, he applied to [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/) and [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/). Not receiving a response from Gainax, he joined Madhouse. Due to a misunderstanding, Gainax failed to process his application until three months later. Not wanting to explain, Yoshinari told Madhouse; \"being an animator is too hard for me,\" and switched to Gainax.\n\nAt Gainax, Yoshinari had joined just after the closure of [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). With nothing to do, he was immediately put onto visual development for the film [Aoki Uru](https://anilist.co/anime/21430/), although the film’s production was later broken off due to the studio’s financial state. Undoubtedly his breakout as an animator was just a few years later when he served as one of the lead animators in [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/). Yoshinari worked at Gainax until leaving for Trigger in 2011, a studio founded by fellow ex-Gainax members, [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/) and [Masahiko Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/). At Trigger he debuted as a director on [Little Witch Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/14349/).\n\nYoshinari is recognized by the way he represents volume and perspective using spheres, especially for smoke and explosions, as well as his character action in general. His characters often borrow traits from western animation, such as rectangular heads, low contrast shading, big eyes and angular lineart. He uses expertly timed smears, dramatic camerawork, and complicated background animation to convey dynamism. His movement is springy and tense, cleanly situated in the dominant cartoony style of ‘00s Gainax. He remarks [Nijitte Monogatari](https://anilist.co/manga/112385/) as one of his most important influences, with his artistic style particularly visible in his design work for [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/) and Little Witch Academia.\n\nAlso a big fan of [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/)’s, having done multiple short [animations](https://anilist.co/anime/123638/) based on his manga characters.\n\nMarried to producer [Naoko Tsutsumi](https://anilist.co/staff/150017/).\n\n(Sources: Wikipedia, Anidb, Animators Wiki)",
