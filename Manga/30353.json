During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/). Some of the more recent works he has provided designs for include [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/), [Ghost Slayers Ayashi](https://anilist.co/anime/1587/), [Noragami](https://anilist.co/anime/20447/) and [Kekkai Sensen](https://anilist.co/anime/20727/).\n\n**Non-anime staff credits:**\n~!\n- Character Design - \"Gigantic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam A year of War\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam F91 Formula Senki 0122\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Return of Zion\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Senki\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE Be Eliminate Yesterday\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"OUT LIVE\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Wonder Project J\" (Video game)\n- Character Design - \"Robot Alchemic Drive\" (Video game)\n- Assistant Chief Animation Director - \"OVER THE MONOCHROME RAINBOW\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Animation Director - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation for \"Ghost in the Shell\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam Cross Dimension 0079\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam PERFECT ONE YEAR WAR\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Kidou Senshi Gundam\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Serial Experiments Lain\" (Video game)\n- Key Animation - \"Spiral Zone\" (ep 5)!~",
