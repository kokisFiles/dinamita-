  "description": "Chairudo are childlike people (even when they have become adults) with each an exceptional supernatural gift, a power. Some are \"firestarters\" for example. The main character, Hinagata Heiji, looks like a loser, but looks are deceptive. He has the uncanny ability to bring to life every inanimate object by bringing the object in touch with his blood. He wanders around, enlisting himself in a school from time to time (after all, he looks like a child). But every \"chairudo\" has got its own territory and conflicts between them, especially about the females, are numerous.<br>\n(Source: Manga Volume)<br>",

          "description": "Makoto Ogino was a Japanese manga artist. A dropout of Nagoya University, his best-known work is the [Peacock King](https://anilist.co/manga/48375/) (孔雀王, Kujaku-Oh) manga series.\n\nPeacock King is Ogino's first manga. It was serialized in Weekly Young Jump from 1986 to 1989, and was published in 17 tankōbon volumes. It follows the adventures of a Buddhist monk who is a member of a secret organization that specializes in demon hunting. The stories involve all sorts of religion and mythology folklore. It was adapted into an OVA series Spirit Warrior and live-action film in 1988. Ogino followed up with Kujaku Ō: Taimaseiden (孔雀王 退魔聖伝) which ran Young Jump magazine from 1990 to 1992, and was published by Shueisha in 11 volumes.\n\nOgino worked on a third Peacock King series, Kujaku Ō: Magarigamiki (孔雀王 曲神紀), which was serialized in Young Jump from 2006 to 2010 for a total of 12 volumes. This continues Kujaku's adventures from Taimaseiden. It focuses on ancient Japan's gods and mythos as it branches from in the middle of the Taimaseiden story line. His fourth series Kujakoh Rising (孔雀王ライジング, Kujaku Ō Rising) ran in Monthly Big Comic Spirits since 2012 and has been published by Shogakukan in 6 volumes. Along with Rising, he published Kujakuoh: Sengoku Tensei (孔雀王-戦国転生-, Kujaku Ō: Sengoku Tensei) starting in 2012 for the magazine Comic Ran Twins.\n\nOgino was an honorary professor of the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art of Fudan University and Master of The Beijing DeTao Masters Academy.\n\nOgino died at 59 on April 29, 2019, due to renal failure.",
