  "description": "Who hasn't thought about reliving their past, correcting perceived mistakes or changing crucial decisions? Would this better your life or the lives of those closest to you? Or would your altered actions prove even more harmful? One man gets the chance to find out...<br><br>\nMiddle-aged Hiroshi Nakahara is on his way home from a business trip when he finds himself on the wrong train heading for his childhood hometown. His footsteps take him to his mother's grave and it's there that he is catapulted back into his life as an 8th grader - but with all his adult memories and knowledge intact. As he struggles to make sense of his predicament his adult memories of his childhood return but are somehow subtly changed. The questions start to form ... would his father still disappear without explanation? would he still marry his wife?<br><br>(Source: Ponent Mon)",

He started doing work for manga magazines in the late nineties, and was a rare example of a western comics artist having some degree of success in the Japanese market.\n\nIn 2001, on the occasion of the simultaneous publication in France and Japan of the critically acclaimed Yukiko's Spinach, he launched the Nouvelle Manga movement in Tokyo, which sought to combine mature sophisticated daily life manga with the artistic style of traditional Franco-Belgian comics.\n\nBoilet's final production work was L'apprenti Japonais. Boilet claims to have finished his editorial career with this work, a book of unused drawings from the twelve years spanning from 1996 to 2008 all concerning the time he had spent in Japan. He now resides again in his native France.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
