  "description": "Munich, Germany, 1923. Two years have passed since Edward Elric was dragged from his own world to ours, leaving behind his country, his friends and his younger brother, Alphonse. Stripped of his alchemical powers, he has been all this time researching rocketry together with Alphonse Heiderich, a young man who resembles his own brother, hoping to one day find a way back home. His efforts so far had proven fruitless, but after lending a hand to a troubled gypsy girl, Edward is thrown in a series of events that can wreak havoc in both worlds. Meanwhile, at his own world, Alphonse Elric ventures deeper into the mysteries of alchemy in search for a way to reunite with his older brother.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "\nHer self-portrait is usually that of a bespectacled cow, as she was born and raised in a dairy farm with three older sisters and a younger brother. Arakawa started out as [Etou Hiroyuki's](https://anilist.co/staff/98901/) assistant writer for [Mahoujin Guru Guru](https://anilist.co/manga/34080/) and a friend of [Shakugan no Shana](https://anilist.co/manga/33074/) author [Yashichiro Takahashi](https://anilist.co/staff/99114/). Arakawa's career started with a work titled [STRAY DOG](https://anilist.co/manga/33303/), but she is best known for creating the [Fullmetal Alchemist](https://anilist.co/manga/30025/) world and manga. The author is friends with [Akira Segami](https://anilist.co/staff/97387/).\n\nDue to a lack of real publicity photos of Arakawa, a great sum of her fanbase has no idea what she really looks like, even to this day. There are some scarce pictures of the real Arakawa in the web, but they are very low in quality and are rarely used as reference. Many fans have mistaken photos of [Romi Park](https://anilist.co/staff/95082/Romi-Park), Edward Elric's seiyuu, as photos of Arakawa, because of the set-up in one particular image in which Romi Park poses as a mangaka. Romi Park is known for representing Arakawa in public appearances, in which Arakawa is not able to attend. \n\n_Awards:_\n• 1999: 9th 21st Century Enix Award for \"Stray Dog\"\n• 2003: 49th Shogakukan Manga Award, Shōnen category for \"Fullmetal Alchemist\"\n• 2011: 15th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize, \"New Artist Prize\" category.\n• 2011: 42nd Seiun Award, \"Best Science Fiction Comic\" category for \"Fullmetal Alchemist\"\n• 2012: 5th Manga Taishō Award for \"Silver Spoon\"\n• 2012: 58th Shogakukan Manga Award, Shōnen category for \"Silver Spoon\"\n• 2013: 1st Contents Award of Japan Food Culture Grand Prize for \"Silver Spoon\"\n• 2023: 1st Rakuten Kobo's E-Book Manga Award, \"I Want to Read it Now!

He went independent after leaving the studio in 1991. As a freelancer he worked on numerous works as a key animator and started quickly getting recognized as one of the strongest action animators in the industry.\n\nIn 2000, Andou made his debut as an episode director with [Medarot](https://anilist.co/anime/1138/)'s 49th episode, and started gradually shifting his focus from animating to directing and storyboarding episodes himself. He mainly worked on studio [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/)' productions in the early '00s, and got to direct several episodes of [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/) and [Fullmetal Alchemist](https://anilist.co/anime/121/). In 2007, he directed [Sword of the Stranger](https://anilist.co/anime/2418/), a film which was also produced by Bones. He has since directed multiple shows for both Bones and [P.A. Works](https://anilist.co/studio/132/).\n\nNoted for his action storyboards.

After switching several studios; from Art Office Sharaku, to Anime Torotoro, to [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), he eventually settled at [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/) with a contract.\n\nNakamura is considered to be among the best action animators, with his scenes featuring catchy movement and effects. Some of his recognizable traits include camera shaking, blurs, and bending and stretching high-speed objects. His fights are praised for its weighty, intense choreographies that are heavy on impact frames. His signature trait is drawing debris as simple cubes, consequentially named \"Yutapon Cubes,\" which are stylistic and easy to draw. Despite being responsible for popularizing it, Nakamura has stated that he started doing it when he noticed [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) doing it. \n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/snjaramaki) | [Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/荒牧伸志) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinji_Aramaki)\n\nAramaki is one of the leading figures in the industry's CG animation, and is noted for his various design works in numerous anime series such as [Gasaraki](https://anilist.co/anime/782/), [Witch Hunter Robin](https://anilist.co/anime/7/), [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/) and [Soul Eater](https://anilist.co/anime/3588/) among many others.\n\nInfluenced by [Space Battleship Yamato](https://anilist.co/anime/1650/), [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/), and Star Wars during his junior and senior high school years, he decided to pursue a career in film. One of his first representative works was an independently produced animation titled \"Moonstruck Artemis,\" that he made while part of a manga club during his university days. Aramaki didn't have a special desire to work in the animation industry, but has stated joining it solely because he could draw and the industry had a wide range of options for someone like that. He has also said that the spread of digital technology has made it easier for him to work in both anime and live-action.\n\nIn 2004, Aramaki directed [Appleseed](https://anilist.co/anime/54/), a re-interpretation of a [Shirou Masamune](https://anilist.co/staff/97609/) manga by [the same name](https://anilist.co/manga/30668/). Although bashed by critics, the movie was an influential piece in the medium that had great impact on creators around the world. Studio Ghibli co-founder [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) said the movie would reform the industry.",

During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films.

In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/).
