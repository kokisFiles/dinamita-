          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/inouetake?s=09) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/inouetake88/)\n\nTakehiko Inoue is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for the basketball series [Slam Dunk](https://anilist.co/manga/30051/), which is one of the best-selling manga series in history, and the samurai manga [Vagabond](https://anilist.co/manga/30656/). Many of his works are about basketball, Inoue himself being a huge fan of the sport. His works sold in North America through Viz Media are Slam Dunk, Vagabond and [Real](https://anilist.co/manga/30657/), although Slam Dunk was earlier translated by Gutsoon! Entertainment. In 2012, Inoue became the first recipient of the Cultural Prize at the Asia Cosmopolitan Awards.\n\nBefore his debut, Inoue was an assistant to [Tsukasa Houjou](https://anilist.co/staff/97623/) on [City Hunter](https://anilist.co/manga/30792/). He made his debut in 1988, when Purple Kaede appeared in Weekly Shounen Jump magazine. It won the 35th annual Tezuka Award. His first serialization was in 1989 with [Chameleon Jail](https://anilist.co/manga/31611/), for which he was the illustrator of a story written by Kazuhiko Watanabe.\n\nInoue's first real fame came with his next manga, Slam Dunk, about a basketball team from Shohoku High School. It was published in Weekly Shounen Jump from 1990 to 1996 and has sold over 120 million copies in Japan alone. In 1995 it received the 40th annual Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen manga and in 2007 was declared Japan's favorite manga. The series was also adapted into a 101 episode [anime television series](https://anilist.co/anime/170/) and five movies.\n\nInoue launched [Buzzer Beater](https://anilist.co/manga/31221/) as an online comic in May 1996. It is about a basketball team from Earth that attempts to compete on the intergalactic level, it appears on his official web site in four languages: Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean. Buzzer Beater beater got two 13-episode anime adaptations in [2005](https://anilist.co/anime/406/) and in [2007](https://anilist.co/anime/2684/).\n\nVagabond was Inoue's next manga, adapted from the fictionalized accounts by Eiji Yoshikawa of the samurai Miyamoto Musashi, which he began drawing in 1998. It won him the Kodansha Manga Award for General manga in 2000 and the Osamu Tezuka Culture Award in 2002.\n\nWhile still working on Vagabond, Inoue began drawing Real in 1999, his third basketball manga, which focuses on wheelchair basketball. It received an Excellence Prize at the 2001 Japan Media Arts Festival.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hosodamamoru)\n\nHosoda initially felt inspired to take up animation as a career after seeing [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/), the first film directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). He majored in oil painting at the Kanazawa College of Art in Ishikawa Prefecture. After graduation, Hosoda was able to land an animation job at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/), after submitting a short film that he had animated in his spare time. He initially applied at [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/); though he did not get the job, he received a rejection letter of praise from Hayao Miyazaki himself.\n\nDuring his time at Toei, Hosoda worked his way up, garnering public attention in the early 2000s with the first two films in the Digimon series. It was his first co-directed film, [Digimon: The Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2961/), which attracted the eye of Ghibli head producer [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/).\n\nStudio Ghibli announced that Hosoda was to direct the film [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/) in September 2001. This was scheduled for a summer 2003 release. However, production on the film became strained due to creative differences. According to Hosoda, he \"was told to make the movie similar to how Miyazaki would have made it, but he wanted to make his own film the way he wanted to make it\". In the end, Hosoda left in the summer of 2002 during the early production stages, after failing to come up with a concept acceptable to Studio Ghibli bosses.\n\nProceeding his departure from Ghibli, Hosoda returned to Toei and worked on a few animations in collaboration with artist Takashi Murakami, such as the commercial Superflat Monogram for Louis Vuitton. During this time, he directed an episode of [Ojamajo Doremi](https://anilist.co/anime/353/), which was inspired by his turbulent time at Ghibli. This episode led to him being hired at the animation studio [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), which he worked at from 2005 to 2011.\n\nAt Madhouse, Hosoda earned critical acclaim with his directing efforts. His two movies, [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/) and [Summer Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/5681/), both won the Japan Academy Film Prize award.\n\nIn 2011, Hosoda left Madhouse to establish his own animation studio, [Studio Chizu](https://anilist.co/studio/555/), with Yuuichirou Saitou who produced both previously mentioned award winning shows. As of August 2020, Studio Chizu has released three films directed by Hosoda: 2012's [Wolf Children](https://anilist.co/anime/12355/), 2015's [The Boy and the Beast](https://anilist.co/anime/20981/), and 2018's [Mirai](https://anilist.co/anime/100749/). Which of Mirai was nominated for Best Animated Feature for the 2019 Oscars.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n__Notable Awards:__\n\n- **The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2007)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2007)\n\\- Winner, Best Animation of the Year (Japan Academy Film Prize 2007)\n\n- **Summer Wars**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Original Story (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Notable Entry (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Animation of the Year (Japan Academy Film Prize 2010)\n\n- **Wolf Children**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Best Screenplay (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Notable Entry (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\n- **Mirai**\n\\- Nominee, Best Animated Feature Film (Academy Awards, USA)\n\n(Source: IMDb)",
