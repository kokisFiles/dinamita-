          "description": "__Alma Mater:__ Yamaguchi Prefectural Ube High School\n\n[Website](http://www.khara.co.jp/hideakianno/)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHideaki Anno is known as one of Japan's celebrity anime directors. In 1984 he founded Studio Gainax along with [Takami Akai](https://anilist.co/staff/102032/Takami-Akai) and [Hiroyuki Yamaga](https://anilist.co/staff/100988/Hiroyuki-Yamaga). As Anno grew up with anime and 8mm experimental film, he brought a mindset of homage and intertextuality novel to anime at the time. He is well known in Japan and has branched out into live action film making, acting, and voice acting in addition to his anime works.\n\n__Style:__\nAnno is a first-rate effects animator, known for drawing very realistic scenes of explosions and debris that bears resemblance to atomic bomb test footage. He was mentored by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/Hayao-Miyazaki) during the making of [*Nausicaä*](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausicaa/), where he drew the giant insect monsters. Though he's done excellent work on a wide variety of shows, his crowning masterpiece of animation is generally accepted to be the [rocket launch sequence](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/110674) in [Wings of the Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/Ouritsu-Uchuugun-Honneamise-no-Tsubasa/). Another great showcase of his skills are [the legendary explosions of DAICON IV](https://sakugabooru.com/data/9586fb64f2d2f687805c8409cedc7ec7.webm).\n\nAs a director, Anno has made a career out of subverting expectations in established genres and tropes. The signatures to his direction are rhythmic jump cuts, [intertitles](https://i.imgur.com/j2Di92w.png), minimal camera movement and avant-garde techniques like emulsion scratches and found footage photomontage. He's also fond of using *Ozuesque* cutaways of urban scenery, particularly things related to infrastructure and technology, such as [power lines](https://i.imgur.com/prfHWLa.jpg). Anno's works are known for being dialogue-driven and for beginning with a light atmosphere before transitioning into the dire. \n\nIn addition to Miyazaki, Anno lists [Ichiro Itano](https://anilist.co/staff/103268/Ichiro-Itano) and [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/Yoshiyuki-Tomino) as artistic influences. He is also a professed fan of Japanese New Wave director [Kihachi Okamoto](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0645477/). Anno is close friends with [Kunihiko Ikuhara](https://anilist.co/staff/100082/Kunihiko-Ikuhara), which fueled rumors that Ikuhara was the model for [*Nagisa Kaworu*](https://anilist.co/character/1261/Kaworu-Nagisa) in Evangelion. Both share a jaundiced view of the anime market and a love for the Japanese avant-garde.\n\n__Biography:__\nAnno established his name as a director with his debut, [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster!](https://anilist.co/anime/949/Gunbuster/), as the 6-episode space opera built up a reputation, in particular for its high-stakes monochrome finale. He would follow this up with being chief director for [Fushigi no Umi no Nadia](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/Fushigi-no-Umi-no-Nadia/), but was absent for an infamous stretch of episodes called the Island arc, where Shinji Higuchi was asked to take over. Due to Nadia's rampant success, the television broadcaster requested another cour of episodes. Anno was working on the series for 18 hours a day at this point.\n\nAnno suffered from depression and became dispirited about anime production after not being permitted the creative freedom he wanted with *Nadia*, which fueled inspiration for one of the most important and popular works of the medium: [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/). It remains a highly unique take on the mecha genre, casting the lead as indecisive and ineffectual instead of the typical enthusiastic, hotheaded hero. The show became infamous for its plot-driven episodes of the first half giving way to increasingly abstract character studies and deconstructions in the second. This reached its pinnacle in the finale episodes which were, due to a mixture of financial issues and Anno skirting the deadline, so experimental that they received significant negative reception. In response, Anno directed a feature-length sequel called [The End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/End-of-Evangelion/) that, though sporting higher production values, was no less experimental and surrealist than the series proper.\n\nEvangelion's massive financial success helped spurn more interest in late night anime, causing a boom in the market. Up to this day it remains a highly influential show, with many visual and narrative references to be found in contemporary anime. \n\nAfter Evangelion, Anno handled the adaptation of shoujo romance [Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/). Despite its more straightforward narrative, its aesthetic was highly distinctive in its use of stills and cropped framings to emulate the experience of reading a shoujo manga, with Anno even filming pages of the manga in a few extreme cases. \n\nIn 2007 Anno decided to leave studio Gainax after several years of poor production and financial mismanagement, and established studio Khara, and began working on the Rebuild of Evangelion film series, which are lavishly animated reboots/continuations of the TV series.\n\n__Non-anime credits:__\n- Writer and director for ''Love & Pop''\n- Writer and director for ''Ritual''\n- Writer and director for ''Ryusei-kacho''\n- Writer and director for ''Cutie Honey (live-action movie)''\n- Writer and director for ''Shin Godzilla''\n- Writer for ''Shin Ultraman''\n- Writer and director for ''Shin Kamen Rider''",

This brought Maeda enough recognition to get invited on the production of [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), and the subseqeunt late '80s [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) films. He also worked on [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s projects during this time.\n\nIn 1992, after having completely cut ties with Ghibli due to differences in working methods, Maeda founded Gonzo together with [Shinji Higuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/107646/), [Hiroshi Yamaguchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97308/) and [Shouji Murahama](https://anilist.co/staff/119708/), who were Gainax employees he had previously worked with on [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/) and [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). At Gonzo he debuted as a director in 1998 with [Blue Submarine No.6](https://anilist.co/anime/1051/).\n\nIn 2004, Maeda directed [Gankutsuou](https://anilist.co/anime/239/), an adaptation of an 1844 novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, by [Alexandre Dumas](https://anilist.co/staff/102535/). Initially Maeda wanted to adapt an Alfred Bester novel, The Stars My Destination, but was rejected by the novel's copyright holders after proposing the numerous changes he wanted to make to the original narrative. He then searched for another work he could adapt into a science fiction setting and ended up going with The Count of Monte Cristo. The series was praised by Western critics and received multiple international accolades.\n\nCalled one of the most imaginative visualists in anime by Helen McCarthy, a British anime reference book author.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nKnown to have been a close friend of [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s before his passing.",

          "description": "[Website](http://joehisaishi.com/) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxyzciBLt1Hyw06dlqwAIkw) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/official_joeh) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joehisaishi.official/)\n\nMamoru Fujisawa, known professionally as Joe Hisaishi, is a Japanese composer and musical director known for over 100 film scores and solo albums dating back to 1981. He has been associated with filmmaker [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) since 1984, having composed scores for all but one of his films. Hisaishi is also widely known for his piano scores.\n\nWhile possessing a stylistically distinct sound, Hisaishi's music has been known to explore and incorporate different genres, including minimalist, experimental electronic, European classical, and Japanese classical. Lesser known are the other musical roles he plays; he is also a typesetter, author, arranger, and conductor. Hisaishi was a student of composer [Takeo Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/106839/).\n\nHisaishi started learning violin in the Violin School Suzuki Shinichi at the age of four, he found his passion in music. At the same age, he also began watching 300 movies a year with his father, which influenced his career. Realizing his love, he attended the Kunitachi College of Music in 1969 to major in music composition. Hisaishi collaborated with minimalist artists as a typesetter, furthering his experience in the musical world.\n\nHe enjoyed his first success of the business in 1974 when he composed music for the anime series called [Gyatoruzu](https://anilist.co/anime/8763/). This and other early works were created under his given name. He presented his first public performance in the mid '70s, spreading his name around his community.\n\nIn 1983, Hisaishi was recommended to create an image album for [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/). Hisaishi and the director of the animated film, Hayao Miyazaki, became great friends and would work together on many future projects. In 1985, he founded his own recording studio—the wonder station. Their collaboration has invited comparisons to the collaborations of Steven Spielberg and John Williams. This big break led to Hisaishi's overwhelming success as a composer of film scores. In 1986, [Laputa: Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/) would be the first feature to appear under the [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) banner, and its gentle, faintly melancholic tone would become a familiar trademark of much of the studio's later output. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding anime industry's top musical contributors, his compositions would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the '80s and '90s.\n\nHisaishi formulated an alias inspired by Quincy Jones, an African-American musician and producer. Re-transcribed in Japanese, \"Quincy Jones\" became \"Joe Hisaishi\". (\"Quincy\", pronounced \"Kuinshī” in Japanese, can be written using the same kanji in \"Hisaishi\"; \"Joe\" comes from \"Jones\".)\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "John Ledford is an entrepreneur and leader in the North American anime industry. In 1992, he founded A.D. Vision (ADV), paving the way for other businesses and the exponential growth anime has had within North America. With ADV's success, Ledford turned his sights to making the imaginative world of anime even more accessible with Anime Network's founding, North America’s first cable TV network dedicated to anime. He later partnered with Kadokawa Publishing and began Newtype USA with translated Japanese content and exclusive U.S. material related to all things anime, manga, and model reviews. This endeavor expanded into ADV Manga, which obtained licensing and publishing rights for hundreds of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.\n\nIn 2008, Ledford founded a new anime-focused company called Sentai Filmworks (Sentai). Since its founding, Sentai provides thousands of hours of content across traditional and digital platforms. Sentai’s dedication to bringing captivating stories, including acclaimed titles such as Grave of the Fireflies, Ninja Scroll, and High School of the Dead to audiences, is ongoing.\n\nLedford’s most recent success is with the 2017 founding of the streaming service HIDIVE. Since launching, HIDIVE is now available via a web browser, mobile devices, gaming platforms, and more. HIDIVE offers new simulcasts every season, an ever-growing collection of dubs, and exclusive titles. The service features DUBCAST SM editions, early access local-language dubs of simulcasts directly produced by HIDIVE, as early as two weeks after the original Japanese broadcast.\n\nFor nearly thirty years now, Ledford continues his goal to further the expansion of anime and the Japanese culture as a whole.",

          "description": "A deeply influential animator of the '80s OVA boom.\n\nWhile still in highschool he was influenced by [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/) and [Kazuhide Tomonaga](https://anilist.co/staff/110219/), joining the former at Studio No.1 once he graduated. After half a year doing in-betweens he debuted as key animator on [New Tetsujin 28](https://anilist.co/anime/4208/) at the age of 19. \n\nHe was known for pushing his mentor's style to the extreme, with even more exagerated poses and flashier effects, becoming in the process as influential as Kanada himself. Some animators who followed his school are [Shinya Oohira](https://anilist.co/staff/103893/) and [Jun Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/114916/). \n\nAt the end of the '90s he was an employee at Square (SQUARE ENIX) and participated on [Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within](https://anilist.co/anime/1361/) as a storyboarder. He left the company soon thereafter but not before working on Final Fantasy X as battle image board designer. ",
