Twelve of their singles have reached number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart, while ten of their albums have become chart-toppers. Six of their full-length releases are among the country's highest-selling albums of all time, including First Love, Distance and Deep River, which are among the top ten best-selling records of Japan's music history.\n\nUtada has performed theme songs for all of the four [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/2759/) reboot movies, as well as for [Freedom](https://anilist.co/anime/1747/) and [To Your Eternity](https://anilist.co/anime/114535/).\n\nAdditionally, they are also known by international audiences for writing and producing four theme-songs to the video game series Kingdom Hearts.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
