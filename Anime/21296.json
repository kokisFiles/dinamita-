  "description": "This is the last time I’m going to practice…\n<br><br>\nNatsuki Enomoto, a third-year student at Sakuragaoka High School, has feelings of unrequited love for her childhood friend, Yuu Setoguchi. Unable to be true to her own feelings, Natsuki tells Yuu that she is merely using him as a stand-in to practice confessing her love to. As Natsuki continues to pretend not having any feelings for Yuu, her classmate Koyuki Ayase asks her out on a date. Will Natsuki ever be able to stop “practicing” and actually confess her love to Yuu?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Aniplex USA)",

Her birth was privately held, and only shown to be on a January 27.\n\n<b>Biography:</b>\nCHiCO is a female japanese singer that is currently under the label: <a href=\"https://musicrayn.com/chico\">MusicRay'n Inc.</a> While growing up CHiCO was very interested in <a href=\"https://jpop.fandom.com/wiki/Anison\">anison</a> (a term used to abbreviate <b>A</b><b>n</b><b>i</b>me <b>s</b><b>o</b><b>n</b>g, but is also used <i>generally</i> when referring to anime music that has a focus on opening and ending theme songs). Upon entering high school she was introduced to a voice training teacher by an acquaintance she knew at the time, this pushed her to become a professional singer.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, CHiCO entered the national singer audition \"Utakatsu!\" (specializing in \"Anison\" and \"Vocaloid\") hosted by Sony Music Entertainment SD Group. She won the grand prize at the contest, which led to a decision to collaborate with the creator group \"[HoneyWorks](https://anilist.co/staff/146863/HoneyWorks)\".\n\nOn the 6th of August, 2014, CHiCO debuted with the opening theme song for the anime \"<a href=\"https://anilist.co/anime/20596/Ao-Haru-Ride/\">Ao Haru Ride</a>\" named \"Sekai wa Koi Ni Ochiteiru\" under the guise of \"CHiCO with HoneyWorks\". This was her official debut as a singer.\n\nOn the 18th of November, 2015, CHiCO together with HoneyWorks released their first album named \"Sekai Ha i Ni Michiteiru\". This was CHiCO's first ever album release, and the album sold 24,000 copies during its first week of sale.",

The guitarist [Oji](https://anilist.co/staff/148135) (Kaizoku Ou), the illustrators Rocoru (in 2013) and [Mogelatte](https://anilist.co/staff/121589/Mogelatte), the video producer Ziro and the pianist [cake](https://anilist.co/staff/147555) (the latter three joining in May 2014) are also part of the group as support members. Later on they acquired the drummer Nakanishi in 2017. However, Rocoru graduated from the group in 2019.\n\nSome of their most popular songs include \"Suki Kirai\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\" and \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\". Their music style consists mostly of positive rocky songs.\n\nIn January 2014 they had their first major debut, with the album \"<i>Zutto Maekara Suki Deshita</i>.\", which ranked in fourth place on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon\">Oricon</a>. In May 2014, the start-up of \"<i>CHiCO with HoneyWorks</i>\" was announced.

Her birth was privately held, and only shown to be on a January 27.\n\n<b>Biography:</b>\nCHiCO is a female japanese singer that is currently under the label: <a href=\"https://musicrayn.com/chico\">MusicRay'n Inc.</a> While growing up CHiCO was very interested in <a href=\"https://jpop.fandom.com/wiki/Anison\">anison</a> (a term used to abbreviate <b>A</b><b>n</b><b>i</b>me <b>s</b><b>o</b><b>n</b>g, but is also used <i>generally</i> when referring to anime music that has a focus on opening and ending theme songs). Upon entering high school she was introduced to a voice training teacher by an acquaintance she knew at the time, this pushed her to become a professional singer.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, CHiCO entered the national singer audition \"Utakatsu!\" (specializing in \"Anison\" and \"Vocaloid\") hosted by Sony Music Entertainment SD Group. She won the grand prize at the contest, which led to a decision to collaborate with the creator group \"[HoneyWorks](https://anilist.co/staff/146863/HoneyWorks)\".\n\nOn the 6th of August, 2014, CHiCO debuted with the opening theme song for the anime \"<a href=\"https://anilist.co/anime/20596/Ao-Haru-Ride/\">Ao Haru Ride</a>\" named \"Sekai wa Koi Ni Ochiteiru\" under the guise of \"CHiCO with HoneyWorks\". This was her official debut as a singer.\n\nOn the 18th of November, 2015, CHiCO together with HoneyWorks released their first album named \"Sekai Ha i Ni Michiteiru\". This was CHiCO's first ever album release, and the album sold 24,000 copies during its first week of sale.",

The guitarist [Oji](https://anilist.co/staff/148135) (Kaizoku Ou), the illustrators Rocoru (in 2013) and [Mogelatte](https://anilist.co/staff/121589/Mogelatte), the video producer Ziro and the pianist [cake](https://anilist.co/staff/147555) (the latter three joining in May 2014) are also part of the group as support members. Later on they acquired the drummer Nakanishi in 2017. However, Rocoru graduated from the group in 2019.\n\nSome of their most popular songs include \"Suki Kirai\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\" and \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\". Their music style consists mostly of positive rocky songs.\n\nIn January 2014 they had their first major debut, with the album \"<i>Zutto Maekara Suki Deshita</i>.\", which ranked in fourth place on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon\">Oricon</a>. In May 2014, the start-up of \"<i>CHiCO with HoneyWorks</i>\" was announced. Sometime in early 2019, the circle began to include subunits: s×c, a duo comprised of shito and cake; and HoneyMonster, comprised of Gom (Kouto), cake, and Nakanishi. The circle also created a number of fictional idols, such as LIP×LIP and Dolce.\n\nIn addition, ten light novels, based on the <a href=\"https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Confession_Executive_Committee_Love_Series\">Confession Executive Committee Love Series</a> songs \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\", \"Yakimochi no Kotae\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\", \"Ima ni Suki Naru.\", \"Koi-Iro ni Sake\", \"Kinyoubi no Ohayou\", \"Heart no Shuchou\", \"Ijiwaru na Deai\", \"Boku ga Namae wo Yobu Hi\", and \"Daikirai na Hazu Datta.\" have been released so far. A short novella about the song \"Watashi, Idol Sengen\" was also included with a CHiCO with Honeyworks album. Light novels for HoneyWorks' other songs do exist as well; the Love and Hate Trilogy (\"Nakimushi Kareshi\", \"Suki-Kirai\", \"Hajimari no Sayonara\") and \"Sekai wa Koi ni Ochiteiru\" and its sequel \"Koi no Chord\" both received one.",
