Garan was one of the subcontracting studios for [Cardcaptor Sakura](https://anilist.co/anime/232/Cardcaptor-Sakura/) and the episodes Kanbe directed garnered much attention. He left Garan in 2000.\n\nMore recently he's been mainly known for directing psychological and thriller anime like [Elfen Lied](https://anilist.co/anime/226/Elfen-Lied/), [Electromagnetic Girlfriend](https://anilist.co/anime/5177/Electromagnetic-Girlfriend/) and [The Promised Neverland](https://anilist.co/anime/101759/The-Promised-Neverland/).",

The group is composed of many vocal artists well known in the genre; aside from the many anime and video game theme songs that this group has performed together, each member is famous for their own solo performances of anime-related music.  As a group, they are perhaps best known for their themes for the Super Robot Wars series of video games.",
