One of his first representative works was an independently produced animation titled \"Moonstruck Artemis,\" that he made while part of a manga club during his university days. Aramaki didn't have a special desire to work in the animation industry, but has stated joining it solely because he could draw and the industry had a wide range of options for someone like that. He has also said that the spread of digital technology has made it easier for him to work in both anime and live-action.\n\nIn 2004, Aramaki directed [Appleseed](https://anilist.co/anime/54/), a re-interpretation of a [Shirou Masamune](https://anilist.co/staff/97609/) manga by [the same name](https://anilist.co/manga/30668/). Although bashed by critics, the movie was an influential piece in the medium that had great impact on creators around the world. Studio Ghibli co-founder [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) said the movie would reform the industry.",

His career began in 1978, debuting as a mechanical designer on [Toushou Daimos](https://anilist.co/anime/2816/), designing the enemy robots. Few years later in 1981, he made his tokusatsu debut on Robot 8-chan.\n\nThe following decade he worked on industry shaping series such as [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/86/), [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/) and [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/). During this time he also had ties to Parallel Creation, a creative group led by sci-fi writer [Aritsune Toyota](https://anilist.co/staff/220367/). This led him to work as an illustrator on novels such as [Record of Lodoss War](https://anilist.co/manga/92655/), in which his designs were deeply influential for Japanese fantasy series.\n\nIn 2002, he directed [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), an anime original created by him. Izubuchi said that his attempt was to set a new standard for mecha anime, as well as to bring back aspects of '70s mecha shows like [Brave Raideen](https://anilist.co/anime/2128/).\n\nA trademark in his mechanical designs is the Buchi-hole (ブチ穴), a series of round holes embedded, usually in a cluster pattern of three holes above and two below, located somewhere on the mecha.",
