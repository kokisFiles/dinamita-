Unfortunately, these troopers are some of the worst low-performing Rico has ever trained as they're Martians and don't take the war seriously. Mars overall has low support for the war as they see their planet unaffected by the bug conflict and even suggested pulling out from the war. Because of their laid back attitude, the denizens of Mars wasn't ready when the bugs attacked. Unknown to everyone, Sky Marshall Amy Snapp executes her plans for power.",

One of his first representative works was an independently produced animation titled \"Moonstruck Artemis,\" that he made while part of a manga club during his university days. Aramaki didn't have a special desire to work in the animation industry, but has stated joining it solely because he could draw and the industry had a wide range of options for someone like that. He has also said that the spread of digital technology has made it easier for him to work in both anime and live-action.\n\nIn 2004, Aramaki directed [Appleseed](https://anilist.co/anime/54/), a re-interpretation of a [Shirou Masamune](https://anilist.co/staff/97609/) manga by [the same name](https://anilist.co/manga/30668/). Although bashed by critics, the movie was an influential piece in the medium that had great impact on creators around the world. Studio Ghibli co-founder [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) said the movie would reform the industry.",
