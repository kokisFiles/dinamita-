The music video of the song on her YouTube channel reached 100 million views in 148 days after its release. Reaching 100 million plays on Billboard Japan after 17 weeks from charting-in was the sixth fastest in history and the youngest for a solo singer. She currently belongs to the artist management company Cloud Nine.\n\nOn June 11, 2021, she was chosen as the second Japanese female Artist for \"YouTube's Artist on the Rise\".\n\nOn January 26, 2022, she released Kyougen (狂言), her first album.\n\nOn June 26, 2024, the J-Pop music group produced by Ado, Phantom Siita (ファントムシータ) debuted.\n\nOn July 10, 2024, she released Zanmu (残夢), her second album.",
