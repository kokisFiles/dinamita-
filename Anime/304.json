Fujishima originally intended to be a draftsman, but took the editorial role after failing to get a drafting apprenticeship. He later became assistant to manga artist [Tatsuya Egawa](https://anilist.co/staff/98034/Tatsuya-Egawa) in the production of the Making Be Free! manga, and in 1986 began his first original manga series You're Under Arrest. His second manga series Oh My Goddess!, also translated as Ah! My Goddess, is Fujishima's most famous work, which made him a household name in Japan. He is also well known as the character designer for several games in the Tales series and Sakura Wars.\n\nHe is known for his love of automobiles and motorcycles, and several of his series and their characters reflect this, such as in éX-Driver and Oh My Goddess!.\n\nOn June 29, 2016, the famous 20-year-old cosplayer Nekomu Otogi announced her marriage to Fujishima as well as her pregnancy on her Twitter page. On July 7, 2016, Fujishima confirmed the marriage on his Twitter account.",

After that he joined [Atelier Giga](https://anilist.co/staff/106775/) and worked there until becoming a freelancer.\n\nHis drawings feature western-influenced delicate and sharp linework with an excellent grasp on three-dimensionality. His character art in particular is highly praised both inside and outside of the industry, which he gets to brandish whenever he works as an animation supervisor. He has stated that he prefers character design and supervision work over working as an animator himself.\n\nIn 2003, he took part as a key animator on [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/)'s animated segment in Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" directed by [Kazuto Nakazawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101474/).

It was in high school that he met a like-minded friend with a love for drawing, sparking his aspiration to become an animator. During those formative years, he actively participated in the art club, where he honed his skills and embarked on creating independent anime projects.\n\nAfter graduating from the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he joined Studio Wombat as an in-between animator. During his time at the Yoyogi Animation Academy, he shared the same class with notable contemporaries such as [Mitsuru Obunai](https://anilist.co/staff/103077/Mitsuru-Obunai), [Yutaka Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/101801/Yutaka-Nakamura), and [Junichi Fujisaku](https://anilist.co/staff/100423/Junichi-Fujisaku).

Gathering with visionaries like [Hikaru Kondou](https://anilist.co/staff/103076/Hikaru-Kondou) in an old apartment in North Ikebukuro, Tokyo, they laid the foundation for what would become a renowned animation studio. In 2009, he made a significant move to the newly opened ufotable Tokushima Studio, where he assumed a leadership role, overseeing and nurturing a team primarily composed of young talents.\n\nOriginally harboring aspirations of becoming a director, he navigated a path from being an animator to realizing his dream. Armed with experiences in key animation and directing, he marked his directorial debut with \"Hanaukyo Maid Team: La Verite.\" Following his move to ufotable Tokushima Studio, he assumed the position of chief of the directing department, leaving his mark on numerous episodes. In his directorial role, he approached each project with careful consideration, assigning cuts to the Tokushima Studio staff thoughtfully, illustrating his dedication and meticulous approach to his craft.",

After graduating he joined [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/) becoming one of their most promising young animators. \n\nAfter some years spent climbing to the position of animation director on series such as [Windy Tales](https://anilist.co/anime/1524/Windy-Tales/), he left his first creative mark on the industry by directing, storyboarding and supervising [Blood+](https://anilist.co/anime/150/)'s kaleidoscopic 3rd Opening. \n\nHe had his directorial debut with [Tokyo Marble Chocolate](https://anilist.co/anime/3088/), OVA produced as a collaboration between Production I.G. and BMG Japan in commemoration of both companies' 20th anniversaries. The OVA was awarded the Grand Prize in the Feature Film Category of the 12th Seoul International Cartoon & Animation Festival in 2008.\n\nShiotani is most famous for being the director of the [Psycho-Pass](https://anilist.co/anime/13601/) series. Initially planned with a post-apocalyptic setting, the concept changed after the Great East Japan Earthquake and evolved into its final form. The series is inspired by detective crime stories and sci-fi (Minority Report, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Patlabor) with the precise intent of exploring societal problems. \n\n",
