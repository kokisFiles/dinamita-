In July 2020, she married fellow voice actor [Kensho Ono](https://anilist.co/staff/95819), whom she had been dating since 2017. \n\n__Early Career__\nHanazawa originally became a child actress at the age of 8. Amongst other roles, she starred in the well-known TV school show _Appare Sanma Daisensei_ and the TV series _Gakkou no Sensei_. At that time she was contracted to Big Apple, and later to Five Eight and Smile Monkey.\n\n__Voice Acting Career__\nAt the age of 14, she made her voice acting debut in 2003 as Holly in _[Last Exile](https://anilist.co/anime/97/)_. Three years later in 2006, she was selected for a major role in TV Tokyo's anime mecha series _[Zegapain](https://anilist.co/anime/878/)_. She was playing the main character's childhood friend, [Kaminagi Ryouko](https://anilist.co/character/2578/), and her performance was one of the main reasons for the character's popularity amongst fans. It was afterwards that she came under contract at prestigious voice acting talent agency Office Osawa in 2007.\n\nHanazawa went to university in 2007, while at the same time, she began to make her mark as a voice actress. She was voted in 2010 as \"Best Female Voice Actress\" by listeners of the radio program Nonko and Nobita's Anime Scramble. She graduated from university in 2011, and in the same year became a full-time voice actress.\n\nHanazawa won Best Supporting Actress at the 9th Seiyuu Awards for her role as [Kosaki Onodera](https://anilist.co/character/52723/) in _[Nisekoi](https://anilist.co/anime/18897/)_. She also won Newtype's Best Voice Actress award in 2015 and later in 2018.\n\n__Music Career__\nOn February 23, 2012, it was announced that Hanazawa would launch her official website. A few days later, during the Kana Hanazawa Solo Debut Presentation Party event, it was announced that she would release four singles within a year: \"Hoshizora Destination\" on April 25, \"Hatsukoi no Oto\" released on July 18, \"Happy Endings\" on October 24 (an ending theme for _[Zetsuen no Tempest](https://anilist.co/anime/14075/)_), and \"Silent Snow\" on January 16, 2013. Her first album Claire was released on February 20, 2013, and her second album 25 was released on February 26, 2014. She released an album title Blue Avenue in April 2015 and went on a concert tour starting at the Nippon Budokan on May 3. The Blu-ray release of the show, Live Avenue Kana Hanazawa in Budokan, ranked number six in sales.\n\n__Trivia__\n- She was invited to Anime Festival Asia 2010 on stage.\n- She used to be a junior idol in Akihabara where hundreds of people came to watch her, which is how she got her breakthrough for her acting career in commercials before becoming a voice actress.\n\n**Non-anime roles:**\n- [Marie](https://anilist.co/character/89069/Marie) - Persona 4 Golden (VG)\n- Hakari Atsuko - Blue Archive (VG)\n- Illya - Memento Mori (VG)\n- Marian - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Modernia - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Alice Kuonji (Caster) - Fate/Grand Order (VG)",
