  "description": "When mankind is threatened by a sudden emergence of undead monsters, those who are bitten become \"Kabane\" - one of them. To survive under the rise of Kabanes, the Hinomoto people have built fortress stations and barricaded themselves inside. Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is the story of those who travel beyond these fortresses.<br><br>\n\nThe movie is a compilation re-telling of the hit TV series Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, told over two parts: Part 1: Light That Gathers & Part 2: Life That Burns. See special content, new additional scenes that appear only in the film, and a remastering of the ending - different from the original TV series!<br><br>\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll, edited)",

In 2005, he made his proper directorial debut with [Otogi-juushi Akazukin](https://anilist.co/anime/402/), a single-episode OVA which was aimed more at figure collectors than at anime fans. Its popularity birthed the full-length series and manga which both came out afterwards.\n\nIn 2006, Araki helmed his first big project with [Death Note](https://anilist.co/anime/1535/), which gained him international praise. He has since gone on to direct numerous series from originals such as [Guilty Crown](https://anilist.co/anime/10793/) and [Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress](https://anilist.co/anime/21196/), to the massively successful adaptation of [Attack on Titan](https://anilist.co/anime/16498/), whose production Araki left with the studio change.\n\nHe's been close friends with [Takayuki Hirao](https://anilist.co/staff/102247/) since their days at [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/). The two have frequently collaborated on numerous projects.\n\nMarried to [Aya Hida](https://anilist.co/staff/144626/).\n\nFreelance, however primarily works at [WIT Studio](https://anilist.co/studio/858/) with Animation Producer [Kazuki Yamanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/196459/).",

After a colleague had pointed this out it started bothering him and he went through great effort to gradually establish his own unique visual style which he is known for today. His career as an animator was short-lived as he realized that he was more interested in just drawing pictures rather than moving them around, and naturally shifted his activities from animation to illustrations and manga.",

Her name comes from the verb \"aimer\" in French which means \"to love.\" She is known for being a faceless voice. She very rarely appears on her music videos and most of her live performances are dimly lit to obscure her face. She finally revealed herself on the August 20, 2016 episode of Music Station.\n\nHer father was the bassist of a band, so Aimer grew up surrounded by music from a very young age. She began studying the piano in elementary school and highly looked up to Ringo Sheena and Utada Hikaru. In junior high school, listening to Avril Lavigne inspired her to take up guitar and began writing English lyrics. At the age of 15, Aimer lost her voice due to over-usage of her vocal cords and was forced to undergo silence therapy for treatment. However, that did not stop her, and after she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky voice.\n\nAimer teamed up with the \"Agehasprings\" group, which has worked with, produced, or provided music for various artists, including Yuki, Mika Nakashima, Flumpool, Superfly, Yuzu, and Genki Rockets. In 2011, her musical career began in earnest. In May 2011, they released the concept album \"Your Favorite Things.\" It covered numerous popular works, including works in various genre such as jazz and country western music.\n\nMarried [Masahiro Tobinai](https://anilist.co/staff/146979/Masahiro-Tobinai) in 2023.",
