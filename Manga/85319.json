  "description": "Long before she would found Fairy Tail, first master Mavis Vermillion is left under the care of the Red Lizard guild. Abused and belittled at every opportunity, she is forced to complete difficult chores. Despite this horrific treatment, Mavis refuses to cry, for if she did, she would not be able to meet the fairies. However, her life of servitude comes to an abrupt end when the Blue Skull guild raids her home, leaving only Mavis and the guild master's daughter Zera alive.\n\nFor many years, Mavis and Zera live alone, taking care of each other. But this all changes when a band of treasure hunters come to the island in search of the Tenrou Jade—a precious gem that is sacred to the island. With the arrival of new faces, her life begins to change again. Mavis has never stopped wishing to meet the fairies, and now she may finally have the chance to find them.",

          "description": "__[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hiro_mashima)__ | __[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQLYbIvGWtClestisnB1_6A)__\n\nJapanese manga artist most known for his manga Groove Adventure Rave, published by Kodansha's Weekly Shonen Magazine, from 1999 to 2005. The series was later adapted into an anime. However, the anime adaption was cancelled before it could complete the series.\n\nIn 2003, he collected some of his one-shot titles in two volumes: Mashima-en- Vol.1 & 2. Those stories include, among others, Cocona, \"Xmas Hearts\" and \"Fairy Tail\", a sort of prototype for his last work.\n\nIn 2006, he began his now finished series, Fairy Tail, serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shonen Magazine. He also published the manga Monster Hunter Orage.\n\nHiro Mashima was a notable guest at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con. He has one daughter.\n\nHis artwork and [Oda Eiichiro](https://anilist.co/staff/96881/EiichiroOda)'s are greatly similar, but that is due to both of them being influenced largely by [Toriyama Akira](https://anilist.co/staff/96901/AkiraToriyama)'s work growing up.\n\nHis former assistant was [Yoshikawa Miki](https://anilist.co/staff/98703/MikiYoshikawa) author of Yankee-kun to Megane-chan.",
