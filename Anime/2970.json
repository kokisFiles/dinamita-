          "description": "**Birthplace:** Fukuoka, Japan\n\nYukihiro Miyamoto, occasionally nicknamed Otokomatsuri, is a Japanese animator and director. He started at animation studio Vega Entertainment, and later joined Shaft. He is best known for directing Puella Magi Madoka Magica and its subsequent film trilogy alongside Akiyuki Shinbo, the latter trilogy which subsequently garnered ¥2 billion, making it a box-office success.\n\nMiyamoto described himself as being a \"heretic\" at Shaft-- someone who, in a company of many differing directors, is only good at doing \"plain work\", and isn't particularly original or creative. Shinbo described Miyamoto in a similar way, but said that he was more like a professional craftsman who leaves their mark in places that cannot be seen.",
