  "description": "Kenshin's new life brings him to Tokyo, where he joins the Kamiya Kasshin-ry&ucirc; dojo to learn the art of \"swords that give life.\" The dojo is peaceful but never boring as Kenshin and his fellow apprentice Yahiko train under the demanding auspices of their kind-hearted instructor, Kamiya Kaoru. But all that changes one afternoon when Tae from the Akabeko restaurant arrives with a pot of beef stew and a plea for help. One of the regulars at the restaurant lost his master's precious book, and he'll be kicked out in the street if he can't recover it. The simple case of a missing book soon becomes a dangerous mystery as Kenshin and his friends are tangled in deep secrets and dark plots!",

          "description": "He once worked as an assistant for his favorite author Takeshi Obata, and is influenced by Marvel comics such as the X-Men and Spider-Man.\n\nWhen Watsuki was a young boy, his brother, who was three years older, drew manga. Watsuki’s older brother was his role model so he started drawing Manga as well. Watsuki was also inspired by a variety of early Manga artists such as Osamu Tezuka and Fujiko F. Fujio. Later on, his brother stopped drawing manga but, \"Because Mr. Watsuki was dumb, he kept drawing it (manga) for a while.” \n\nWhen Watsuki was in middle school, he practiced kendo. He still drew manga but also enjoyed sports. Watsuki admits that he was “so weak, in fact, that I was an embarrassment to my 183 centimeters of height.\" Watsuki never won a kendo match. He was once chosen to be a starter after a teammate was suspended for causing an uproar. Watsuki grew frustrated with kendo, and eventually quit. When he was challenged to come up with a new character for Rurouni Kenshin, he used his outlook on kendo to design Yahiko Myōjin. In high school, he won the Hop Step award for his work on the series _Podmark_. Not much is known about _Podmark_ because it has not been translated to English. \n\nWhen not working on manga, Watsuki enjoys playing video games, reading other manga, and watching television. His favorite American comic series is _X-Men_ because he likes the action. His favorite anime (other than his own) is _Neon Genesis Evangelion_. He likes video games like _Samurai Spirits_, and action movies like _Die Hard_ and _The Matrix_. \n\nIn November 2017, Tokyo Police raided Watsuki's home as part of an investigation into the purchase of child pornography. The search uncovered DVDs containing videos of naked girls less than 18 years of age. The serialization of _Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc_ was put on hiatus after the details of Watsuki's charges were made public. In February 2018, Watsuki was fined ¥200,000. _The Hokkaido Arc_ resumed serialization in June 2018.",
