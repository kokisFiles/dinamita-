  "description": "Mirai, an improved Kongou-class Aegis guided missile destroyer, is one of the newest and most advanced ships in the entire Japanese Self Defense Force (SDF). Her crew, also one of the newest, is lead by Capt. Umezu Saburo and Executive Officer Kadomatsu Yosuke. While running scheduled training exercises one day, Mirai encounters a fierce storm that throws their navigation systems into temporary disarray. After a few minutes of recovery, the crew is shocked to discover that they've been transported back in time to June 4, 1942&mdash;The Battle of Midway, during World War II. Letting history take its course for this battle, they manage to avoid the conflict firsthand and make a vow to remain annonymous, changing history as little as possible. However, when the crew comes across the dying Lt. Commander Kusaka Takumi, XO. Kadomatsu's instincts to save lives takes over, changing the course of history more than he could've imagined.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

He graduated from Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1986. Sahashi has composed music for various anime series (including OVAs, films, and drama CDs), video games, films, dramas, and musicals.\n\nThe style of his composition is richly symphonic and classical (occasionally jazz). The use of sophisticated compositional techniques, as well as complicated harmony writing such as fugue can often be heard in his work, demonstrating his solid training in the western classical music. He also uses keyboard instruments to deliver more sentimental soundtracks to good effect.",

In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",
