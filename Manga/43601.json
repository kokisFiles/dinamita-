  "description": "Akira Sasanishiki, a math teacher at an elite high school where only grades matter, is a womanizing motorcycle freak who goes against school policy and helps students in need. To the school, this young teacher is a trouble-maker and a problem.<br><br>\nWhat is love? What is friendship? What is sex? What is violence? What is justice? What is evil? What is the \"perfect society\"? What is the \"real world\" like? With each student made to tackle the various problems that they must face to grow up - sometimes comically and sometimes seriously - this work is a kind of bible for the young generation.\n",
