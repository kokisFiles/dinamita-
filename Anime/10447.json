He is also praised for his shot composition skills and copies of his layouts are widely distributed in the industry as drawing reference. Nowadays he is mostly only credited for character design in the shows he participates in, but in reality he works as an animation director uncredited quite often.

One of his favourites shows included [Seisenshi Dunbine](https://anilist.co/anime/929/).\n\nIn the late '80s, he joined [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/) as a production assistant after finding out that it's how many of the studio's directors started off. There he met and studied under [Shuuji Iuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/115833/) on his shows [Madou King Granzort](https://anilist.co/anime/2818/) and [Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru](https://anilist.co/anime/4807/). Then after having gone freelance he got his first shot as a director as one of the three unit directors on Iuchi's [Ranma ½ film](https://anilist.co/anime/418/) in 1991.\n\nIn 2001, Yamamoto made his debut as a series director on [Shiawase Sou no Okojo-san](https://anilist.co/anime/2934/), soon after which he worked as the first director of the long-running [Keroro Gunsou](https://anilist.co/anime/516/).
