Soon after, at the age of 19, he got his first major break when he landed the role of mecha designer on [Dancouga: Super Beast Machine God](https://anilist.co/anime/2255/). Not too long after, at the young age of 21, he was given his first directorial role by directing episodes 5 and 6 of the [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/) OVA series. \n\nOobari mainly likes to work within the sci-fi mecha and fighting genres. His designs are easily recognizable from the voluptuous female forms and well-toned pretty boys he tends to create to appeal to wide audiences. For references, he likes to use images of professional wrestlers and models. He is friends with fellow former animator and current freelance illustrator [Tsukasa Kotoboki](https://anilist.co/staff/97965/).\n\nHe wasn't originally interested in animation but was inspired by [Satoshi Urushihara](https://anilist.co/staff/98177/).",

He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work. Another of his most important work is often said to be [Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar](https://anilist.co/anime/890/), and the [sequel](https://anilist.co/anime/1382/) following it.\n\nIn 2002, he won the first Tokyo Anime Award for Best Music for his work on [Overman King Gainer](https://anilist.co/anime/1792/).",

One of his favourites shows included [Seisenshi Dunbine](https://anilist.co/anime/929/).\n\nIn the late '80s, he joined [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/) as a production assistant after finding out that it's how many of the studio's directors started off. There he met and studied under [Shuuji Iuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/115833/) on his shows [Madou King Granzort](https://anilist.co/anime/2818/) and [Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru](https://anilist.co/anime/4807/). Then after having gone freelance he got his first shot as a director as one of the three unit directors on Iuchi's [Ranma ½ film](https://anilist.co/anime/418/) in 1991.\n\nIn 2001, Yamamoto made his debut as a series director on [Shiawase Sou no Okojo-san](https://anilist.co/anime/2934/), soon after which he worked as the first director of the long-running [Keroro Gunsou](https://anilist.co/anime/516/). In 2006 he directed the well-received [NHK ni Youkoso!](https://anilist.co/anime/1210/)\n\nMore recent directorial works of his include [Yama no Susume](https://anilist.co/anime/14355/) and [Shounen Maid](https://anilist.co/anime/21321/).",
