After having graduated high school in 1973, he left Miyagi, heading to Tokyo with the hopes of becoming a mangaka. He made his debut later on the same year with a manga adaptation of Prosper Mérimée's short novel Mateo Falcone, titled A Gun Report. In 1979, after writing multiple short-stories for the magazine Action, Ootomo created his first science-fiction work, titled Fireball. Although the manga was never completed, it is regarded as a milestone in Ootomo's career, containing many of the same themes he would later explore in [Doumu](https://anilist.co/manga/31215/), which began serialization in January 1980 and ran for two years until completed.\n\nIn 1982, Ootomo made his anime debut as character designer on [Harmagedon](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/). After this Ootomo began working on Akira, which would become his most acclaimed and famous work. The manga took eight years to complete and would eventually culminate in 2000 pages of artwork.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He wanted to work with esteemed Director [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki) since [Gamba's Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/Gambas-Adventure/) was particularly striking to him.\n\nInterested in effects animation, he cites [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada) and [Kazuhide Tomonaga](https://anilist.co/staff/110219/Kazuhide-Tomonaga) as major influences. He had his first breakthrough as animator on [Space Adventure Cobra](https://anilist.co/anime/2451/Space-Adventure-Cobra/) and [Golgo 13: The Professional](https://anilist.co/anime/1760/), in which his effects work and fun character animation was highly praised. Later his work became increasingly more experimental, combining his animation with intricate art design and CGI.\n\nDuring his period at Annapuru he befriended [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/Takashi-Nakamura) and the two worked on several projects together even after leaving the studio. [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Ootomo) recognized his talent and Morimoto became a key figure in many of his works. He debuted as Director on [Robot Carnival](https://anilist.co/anime/2182/Robot-Carnival/).\n\nIn 1985 he founded [Studio 4°C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/) alongside former Ghibli producer [Eiko Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/103607/Tanaka-Eiko).

Otsuka later named Sadamoto one of the three men more skillful than him. Though Sadamoto is not an unskilled animator by any means, his reputation rests mainly on his iconic character designs, evident in the reception of the Evangelion cast. Nearly all of Gainax' biggest productions have their characters designed by Sadamoto. He is one of the biggest contributors to the general look of Gainax anime and has proven to be massively influential for character designers of future generations.\n\nSadamoto's characters are often thin, fragile and have sharp yet understated facial features. He pays a lot of attention to fashion as well.\n\nMost of Sadamoto's influences are mangaka such as [Katsuhiro Otomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Otomo), [Yoshitaka Amano](https://anilist.co/staff/97967/Yoshitaka-Amano), [Kazuo Umezu](https://anilist.co/staff/97777/Kazuo-Umezu), and [Leiji Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/97597/Leiji-Matsumoto). Sadamoto would go on to author the Evangelion manga. \n\nPost-Gainax he has remained active as character designer, mostly for [Mamoru Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/Mamoru-Hosoda)'s popular feature films. He has also focused on different visual and illustration works, as he worked on several manga and is co-creator and character designer for the .hack game franchise.",

          "description": "[Website](http://joehisaishi.com/) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxyzciBLt1Hyw06dlqwAIkw) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/official_joeh) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joehisaishi.official/)\n\nMamoru Fujisawa, known professionally as Joe Hisaishi, is a Japanese composer and musical director known for over 100 film scores and solo albums dating back to 1981. He has been associated with filmmaker [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) since 1984, having composed scores for all but one of his films. Hisaishi is also widely known for his piano scores.\n\nWhile possessing a stylistically distinct sound, Hisaishi's music has been known to explore and incorporate different genres, including minimalist, experimental electronic, European classical, and Japanese classical. Lesser known are the other musical roles he plays; he is also a typesetter, author, arranger, and conductor. Hisaishi was a student of composer [Takeo Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/106839/).\n\nHisaishi started learning violin in the Violin School Suzuki Shinichi at the age of four, he found his passion in music. At the same age, he also began watching 300 movies a year with his father, which influenced his career. Realizing his love, he attended the Kunitachi College of Music in 1969 to major in music composition. Hisaishi collaborated with minimalist artists as a typesetter, furthering his experience in the musical world.\n\nHe enjoyed his first success of the business in 1974 when he composed music for the anime series called [Gyatoruzu](https://anilist.co/anime/8763/). This and other early works were created under his given name. He presented his first public performance in the mid '70s, spreading his name around his community.\n\nIn 1983, Hisaishi was recommended to create an image album for [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/). Hisaishi and the director of the animated film, Hayao Miyazaki, became great friends and would work together on many future projects. In 1985, he founded his own recording studio—the wonder station. Their collaboration has invited comparisons to the collaborations of Steven Spielberg and John Williams. This big break led to Hisaishi's overwhelming success as a composer of film scores. In 1986, [Laputa: Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/) would be the first feature to appear under the [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) banner, and its gentle, faintly melancholic tone would become a familiar trademark of much of the studio's later output. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding anime industry's top musical contributors, his compositions would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the '80s and '90s.\n\nHisaishi formulated an alias inspired by Quincy Jones, an African-American musician and producer. Re-transcribed in Japanese, \"Quincy Jones\" became \"Joe Hisaishi\". (\"Quincy\", pronounced \"Kuinshī” in Japanese, can be written using the same kanji in \"Hisaishi\"; \"Joe\" comes from \"Jones\".)\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

This brought Maeda enough recognition to get invited on the production of [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), and the subseqeunt late '80s [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) films. He also worked on [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s projects during this time.\n\nIn 1992, after having completely cut ties with Ghibli due to differences in working methods, Maeda founded Gonzo together with [Shinji Higuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/107646/), [Hiroshi Yamaguchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97308/) and [Shouji Murahama](https://anilist.co/staff/119708/), who were Gainax employees he had previously worked with on [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/) and [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). At Gonzo he debuted as a director in 1998 with [Blue Submarine No.6](https://anilist.co/anime/1051/).\n\nIn 2004, Maeda directed [Gankutsuou](https://anilist.co/anime/239/), an adaptation of an 1844 novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, by [Alexandre Dumas](https://anilist.co/staff/102535/). Initially Maeda wanted to adapt an Alfred Bester novel, The Stars My Destination, but was rejected by the novel's copyright holders after proposing the numerous changes he wanted to make to the original narrative. He then searched for another work he could adapt into a science fiction setting and ended up going with The Count of Monte Cristo. The series was praised by Western critics and received multiple international accolades.\n\nCalled one of the most imaginative visualists in anime by Helen McCarthy, a British anime reference book author.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nKnown to have been a close friend of [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s before his passing.",
