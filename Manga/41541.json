Today she is one of the most popular Boys' Love authors.  Her doujinshi circle is called K2 Company. Since she got her start doing shonen manga, she was embarassed to write under her real name, so she wrote under \"Kazuma\", which is a man's name, but she decided to keep it when she started writing female-oriented stories.",
