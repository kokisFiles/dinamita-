The first part, Gunbuster the Movie, condenses the six episodes of the original OVA into a 95-minute moviefeaturing a new 5.1 audio remix and a redub by the original Japanese cast. The second part, Die Buster the Movie, mixes large chunks of the second OVA series with a few altered or newly-animated scenes to create a truncated take on Nono's story. <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

He was mostly active in the '80s and '90s, during which he rose to prominence and got recognized as one of the pre-eminent character designers of his time.\n\nMikimoto attended university at the same time as mangaka [Fujihiko Hosono](https://anilist.co/staff/100345/), as well as [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) and [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/), both of whom he would later collaborate with on the creation of [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) - perhaps Mikimoto's most famous work.\n\nAt the time of his debut, he was a fan of [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s and it was showing in his drawings. After a colleague had pointed this out it started bothering him and he went through great effort to gradually establish his own unique visual style which he is known for today. His career as an animator was short-lived as he realized that he was more interested in just drawing pictures rather than moving them around, and naturally shifted his activities from animation to illustrations and manga.",

At the time he was very unexperienced with anime production and has [said](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he likely would have been fired for his lack of knowledge and poor quality work, if not for the in-between animation checker teaching him everything from scratch.\n\nLater down the line after establishing himself more in the anime industry, he would go on to work on \"[Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/Tengen-Toppa-Gurren-Lagann/)\" as a challenge to himself, where he would put forth mecha and effects animation he had no idea how to prior.\n\nKojima [states](https://www.arabnews.jp/article/arts-culture/article_26145/) he feels a lot of inspiration from manga artists who are able to think about a story, break it up into panels, and express it in pictures. He has thought about drawing a manga himself, even if it's something simple.\n\nSome of his favorite anime are \"[Inital D](https://anilist.co/anime/185/Initial-D/),\" \"[Natsume's Book of Friends](https://anilist.co/anime/4081/Natsume-Yuujinchou/),\" \"[Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-](https://anilist.co/anime/21355/ReZero-kara-Hajimeru-Isekai-Seikatsu/),\" \"[Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Shin-Seiki-Evangelion/),\" \"[A KITE](https://anilist.co/anime/320/A-KITE/),\" \"[JIN-ROH](https://anilist.co/anime/570/JINROH/),\" \"[FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/)\" and \"[Doukyuusei -Classmates-](https://anilist.co/anime/21096/Doukyuusei/).\"\n\nSome of his favorite manga are \"[HI Score Girl](https://anilist.co/manga/74501/Hi-Score-Girl/)\" and \"[A White Rose in Bloom](https://anilist.co/manga/108360/Mejirobana-no-Saku/).\"\n",

Amemiya's [animation and directing](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mini-imaishi.mp4) is very similar to Imaishi's yet is less chaotic and contains more 'retro' devices like impact frames and multi-tonal shading, drawing a lot of inspiration from [Masami Obari](https://anilist.co/staff/100660/Masami-Obari). For these reasons he was frequently typecasted for old school pose-heavy mecha combat.\n\nAmemiya is a nerdy director whose anime often heavily references other series and artists he loves, sometimes even replicating Obari's [animation sequences](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dangaioh2.mp4) and [layouts](https://i.imgur.com/nTRdM4K.jpg), [Transformer](https://twitter.com/SSS_SGRID/status/1051063114022572033)'s color designs, and Hideaki Anno's [establishing shots](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/welcome-to-the-anno-class.jpg) as well as long-lingering framing. Amemiya called Anno's [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/) his [favorite series before](https://i.imgur.com/nEYK186.png). Between his ode-heavy artistry he interjects personality with [subtle details](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/what-kind-of-brand-is-TOMATO-LIFE-tho.jpg), visual gags, and repurposing tonally contrasting homages into a different context.\n\nAmemiya graduated from Tokyo University of Technology and was part of the university's anime research society. During his time there he became heavily influenced by Osaka University's anime research club [Group CAS](https://twitter.com/group_cas). At the time [Toshiyuki Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/107357/Toshiyuki-Satou) was part of the group, while [Ikehata Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/120505/Ikehata-Hiroshi) visited regularly. After a bit of indie work Amemiya joined studio Gainax and climbed up the hierarchy: from clean-up to animation direction, onto storyboarding and episode directing, until after joining studio Trigger and co-directing Kill la Kill finally having the credentials to debut with his own series.\n\nHe is married to animator [Megumi Kouno](https://anilist.co/staff/120602/Megumi-Kouno).\n\n",

          "description": "Hiroyuki Yamaga is a director, writer, and anime producer, and is best known for being president and representative director of studio Gainax that he established together with fellow Osaka University of Arts students [Takami Akai](https://anilist.co/staff/102032/) and [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/).\n\nAfter directing the successful DAICON III Opening Animation, he went professional at Studio Nue's request, joining the production staff of 1982's [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/). In 1984 he began working on the production of Gainax' first professional work, [Ouritsu Uchuugun: Honneamise no Tsubasa](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), an alternate universe retelling of the first space shuttle launch. The movie was released in 1987 and despite its initial domestic box office failure, the film and Yamaga's bold vision garnered a lot of attention and it later became a cult classic remembered as one of the defining works of science fiction in anime.\n\nYamaga's creative output slowed down after Honneamise. He directed [Mahoromatic](https://anilist.co/anime/276/) and [Abenobashi Mahou Shoutengai](https://anilist.co/anime/306/), but he would mostly keep himself to managerial duties after failing to get several projects off the ground. In 2019, he directed the second season of [Piano no Mori](https://anilist.co/anime/103049/), working as a series directed for the first time since Mahoromatic's second season in 2002.",

He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work. Another of his most important work is often said to be [Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar](https://anilist.co/anime/890/), and the [sequel](https://anilist.co/anime/1382/) following it.\n\nIn 2002, he won the first Tokyo Anime Award for Best Music for his work on [Overman King Gainer](https://anilist.co/anime/1792/).",

There he made his debut as an animation director on the premiere of [Mahoromatic](https://anilist.co/anime/277/)'s second season.\n\nIn 2005, he made his debut as a character designer, although still jointly together with Sushio and [Takaaki Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/110187/), on the 6th [One Piece](https://anilist.co/anime/464/) movie. The film was directed by Mamoru Hosoda, which led to Kubota getting an invite to join the production of [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/) as an animation director. After this he kept working at Gainax until going freelance.\n\nIn 2012, he worked as the main character designer on [From the New World](https://anilist.co/anime/13125/) and [Robotics;Notes](https://anilist.co/anime/13599/), and a few years later he served as one on [One-Punch Man](https://anilist.co/anime/21087/), which earned him international fame.",
