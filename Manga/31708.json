  "description": "Ichihashi Nanao is an incredibly bright girl and the first to ever transfer into Mehabia Catholic School. The one God here, though, is the \"Judicature Club,\" a school-sanctioned means of resolving student disputes. Its president and judge is the first person Nanao meets--Hanegi Raika, a handsome boy who looks like a girl. This highly selective club wants Nanao as a member, but while she may be unwilling to judge others, she may have no choice when she herself is judged.<br><br>\nSource: ShoujoMagic",

          "description": "[Official Website](https://www.mizushilog.com/) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/setona_mizushiro/)\n\nSetona Mizushiro's first real dabble in the world of creating manga was in 1985 when she participated in the publication of a dojinshi. She remained active in the dojinshi world until she debuted in April of 1993 with her short single \"Fuyu ga Owarou Toshiteita\" (Winter Was Ending) that ran in Shogakukan's Puchi Comic magazine. For this work she was awarded the 31st Shougakugan New Author Comic Award.\n\nMizushiro-sensei is well-known for her series \"X-Day\" in which she exhibits an outstanding ability to delve into psychological issues of every nature. Besides manga, Mizushiro-sensei has an affinity for chocolate, her two cats (Jam and Nene), and round sparkly objects.\n\nMizushiro-sensei often travels to Paris.",
