Recurring themes and aesthetics in his works include oppressive police states, unsuccessful protest movements, dysfunctional bureaucracies, political action that results in stasis, biblical scripture, and imagery, philosophical dilemmas, characters trapped in seemingly inescapable situations, the use of dialog as descriptive \"texture\" rather than a plot-driver, and otherwise Euro-arthouse pacing and storyboarding. He is both polarizing to mainstream audiences, and highly revered by cinephiles and Hollywood directors; his works have influenced Hollywood films such as Dark City, The Matrix, and Avatar.\n\n[Kenji Kamiyama](https://anilist.co/staff/100348/), an anime director also closely associated with [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), is his protégé.",

This OVA was an important outing of the '90s, uniting many veteran artists and talented newcomers. \n\nHe debuted as director on [Mind Game](https://anilist.co/anime/875/Mind-Game/), an abstract piece combining animation and live-action footage, winning the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival (overcoming even Hayao Miyazaki's [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/)), and earning [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/Yoshiyuki-Tomino)'s praise, who acted as the chief judge. After Mind Game Yuasa spent several years at [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE) working on various projects. In 2013, he founded [Science SARU](https://anilist.co/studio/6145/Science-SARU) alongside his close affiliate [Eun-Yeong Choi](https://anilist.co/staff/115088/EunYeong-Choi).\n\nOn March 25, 2020 it was announced Yuasa stepped down as the CEO of Science SARU. He would work there as director until the completion of his latest Movie, [Inu-Oh](https://anilist.co/anime/109928/InuOh/), and would later cease any affiliation with the studio.\n\nOn February 17, 2025 it was announced that Yuasa would launch of his own animation studio, ame pippin. Their debut project would be the film [Daisy's Life](https://anilist.co/anime/190574/Hinagiku-no-Jinsei/).",

In 2010, he graduated from *Gobelins* - a Parisian animation school. He was a co-director of two animated shorts, *Fenrir* and *Le Royaume* and designing the backgrounds for the video game *Rayman Legends*, which he gained some acclaim for. However, Aymeric is best known for his backgrounds on [Masaki Yuaasa](https://anilist.co/staff/100068/Masaaki-Yuasa)'s and [Eunyoung Choi](https://anilist.co/staff/115088/Eunyoung-Choi)'s projects. \n\nAymeric's tendency towards vibrant, slightly warped urban locales was uniquely suited to the Yuasa School's direction. Thought he generally uses Photoshop for cleanly executed lineart in his backgrounds, Aymeric's backgrounds in Ping Pong The Animation were all hand drawn in pencil.\n\nHe worked as a concept artist at Riot Games in Los Angeles, but as per September 2019, he left. He now currently works as Production Designer at Sony Pictures Animation.\n",
