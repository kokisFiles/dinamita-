  "description": "<b>Volume 1</b><br>\nAs a small child, Sakashita Noboru saw some girls from Seihou Academy and was attracted to their beauty and cute uniforms. He decided to enrol there and to get a wealthy girlfriend. Coming from a common family, he has to study hard. However, even upon finally becoming a student in Seihou, the girls only have eyes for his rival: Yuuki. After a small incident, Sakashita becomes close friends with his former rival. But what are Yuuki’s real intentions for getting so near to Sakashita?\n<br><br>\n<b>Volume 2</b><br>\nThe truth is, I think that I might already be caught in his trap. As usual, Yuuki's attacks are fierce... and he's sometimes kind, and it's just the matter of a countdown until we have our happy end... I think that, too. But. But, well. He really is a rich kid, and I'm just an ordinary guy. The worlds we live in are different. Incidents happen to make me realize that again. Yuuki... are you going to go so far as to take away my pride?!\n<br><br>\n<b>Volume 3</b><br>\nYuuki's a snob, but he's also earnest and passionate. He's been courting me, and I've slowly fallen for him. He's my boyfriend now. My brothers have gotten attached to him too, and he jokes that he wants to marry me and join my family. But Kazushi-sempai doesn't like the thought of Yuuki being happy. He told Yuuki's older brother, who's living in America, about our relationship. His brother came back to Japan and told the two of us to break things off. Now Yuuki's rebelled against him and ran away from home...?\n<br><br>\n<b>Included one-shot:</b><br>\nVolume 1: Pleasure Point\n",
