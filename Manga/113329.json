          "description": "Moto Hagio is considered a \"founding mother\" of modern shoujo manga. She is also a member of the Year 24 Group. \n\nMoto Hagio made her professional debut in 1969 at the age of 20 with her short story [Lulu to Mimi](https://anilist.co/manga/116322) in Nakayoshi. Later, for Shogakukan Publishing, she produced a series of short stories for various magazines.\n\nTwo years after her debut, she published [11-gatsu no Gymnasium](https://anilist.co/manga/107023/11), a short story which dealt openly with love between two boys at a boarding school. The story was part of a larger movement by female manga artists at the time which pioneered a genre of girls' comics about love between young men. In 1974, Hagio developed this story into the longer [Thomas no Shinzou](https://anilist.co/manga/39152).\n\nShe was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1976 for her science fiction classic [11-nin Iru!](https://anilist.co/manga/48752) and her epic tale [Poe no Ichizoku](https://anilist.co/manga/34305).",
