Konaka is a Japanese writer and scenarist best known for shows such as [Serial Experiments Lain](https://anilist.co/anime/339/), [Digimon Tamers](https://anilist.co/anime/874/) and [Texhnolyze](https://anilist.co/anime/26/). He is also known to be the creator of Ultraman Gaia, as cited by Tsuburaya Productions.\n\nKonaka's serious works generally have a dark, psychological tone. As a Cthulhu Mythos writer, he tends to add Lovecraftian elements to his works.\n\n\"Chiaki J. Konaka\" is a very unusual name, as Japanese names typically do not include middle names. Konaka states that the \"J.\" evokes the \"Christian\" name \"John\", due to him being born to parents who were members of the Anglican Church, but he does not identify as Christian. He began using the \"J.\" at the age of 12, when he began making 8 mm films; he patterned the style after Western names such as \"Charles M. Schulz\".\n\nHe has cited [Ghost Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/2596/) as his favorite screenwriting project.",

          "description": "He initially aspired to be a professional mangaka and moved to Tokyo to pursue his dream. In 1971, he joined at Tatsunoko Pro as painter before becoming animator. After leaving the company he went freelance and participated in many works in different roles, ranging from key animator to episode director, before making his proper directorial debut with a short film titled Chicken Man & Red Head, which was a part of the [Robot Carnival](https://anilist.co/anime/2182/) anthology.\n\nNakamura revolutionized anime in the early '80s with his more realistic, extremely detailed and fluid style of animation. He is one of the few animators who has proven that he can successfully take on almost all of the creative burden on a project, proven in both his Robot Carnival short and episode 4 of [Hakkenden](https://anilist.co/anime/1822/).\n\nHis 2001 film, [A Tree of Palme](https://anilist.co/anime/1141/), was an official selection of the Berlin Film Festival.",
