  "description": "Just before the start of the French Revolution, a commoner named Gerard pays a visit to a high-class brothel, where he sleeps with, and then buys the freedom of Jacques, a young noble sold into prostitution.  Jacques looks down on commoners and Gerard has his reasons for hating the nobility, but they&rsquo;re thrown together once again when Jacques ends up being hired as Gerard&rsquo;s new houseboy.  Jacques&rsquo; determination to make his own way in the world, and Gerard&rsquo;s surprising, quirky shows of kindness slowly bring the two together into a romance for the ages!<br><br>(Source: Blu Manga)",

          "description": "Yoshinaga debuted in 1994 with The Moon and the Sandals, serialized in Hanaoto magazine, but was previously a participant in comic markets. Of Yoshinaga's many works, several have been licensed internationally. She was also selected and exhibited as one of the \"Twenty Major Mangaka Who Contributed to the World of Shojo Manga (World War II to Present)\" for Professor Masami Toku's exhibition, \"Shojo Manga: Girl Power!\" at CSU-Chico.\nOutside of her work with Japanese publishers, she also self-publishes original doujinshi on a regular basis, most notably for Antique Bakery. Yoshinaga has also drawn fan parodies of Slam Dunk, Rose of Versailles, and Legend of Galactic Heroes.\n\nAlthough little is known about Yoshinaga's personal life, she mentions that her favorite operas are those by Mozart in the author's note to Solfege.\nIn an interview, she has said that \"I want to show the people who didn't win, whose dreams didn't come true. It is not possible for everybody to get first prize. I want my readers to understand the happiness that people can get from trying hard, going through the process, and getting frustrated.\" ",
