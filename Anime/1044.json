          "description": "__Residency:__ Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan\n__Graduated:__ Gakushuin University (Department of Economics)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, script/screenwriter, author, mangaka and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He is the second of four brothers, and was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyou Ward. He is best known for his international fame as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of astonishing animated feature films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\n\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014, as well as having won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature, the only instances in which a non-English-language film has won the award. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n__Biography:__\nMiyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, which led to him eventually joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation) in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with the director [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/Isao-Takahata). Some notable films Miyazaki contributed to at Toei include [Doggie March](https://anilist.co/anime/9228/Wan-Wan-Chuushingura/) and [Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/2833/Gullivers-Travels-Beyond-the-Moon/). He provided key animation in other films at Toei, such as the Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to animation studio A-Pro in 1971, where he would co-direct the movie Lupin the Third Part I alongside Isao Takahata. After moving to Zuiyou Eizou (later dubbed [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/Nippon-Animation)) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/Future-Boy-Conan/). He joined [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/Telecom-Animation-Film)/Tokyo Movie Shinsa in 1979 to direct his first feature films, [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/) in 1979 and [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/) in 1984, as well as the television series [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/Sherlock-Hound/).\n\nMiyazaki co-founded [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/Studio-Ghibli) in 1985. He would go on to direct numerous of films with Ghibli, including [Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/Castle-in-the-Sky/) (1986), [My Neighbor Totoro](https://anilist.co/anime/523/My-Neighbor-Totoro/) (1988), [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/Kikis-Delivery-Service/) (1989), and [Porco Rosso](https://anilist.co/anime/416/Porco-Rosso/) (1992). The films they made were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. His film [Princess Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/Princess-Mononoke/) was the first animated film to ever win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and it briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997, and its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Studio Ghibli's popularity and influence outside of Japan. His 2001 film [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/Spirited-Away/) became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films, [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/) (2004), [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/Ponyo/) (2008), and [The Wind Rises](https://anilist.co/anime/16662/The-Wind-Rises/) (2013) also enjoyed critical and commercial success.\n\nFollowing the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned again in 2016 to work on a new feature film, [The Boy and The Heron](https://anilist.co/anime/109979/The-Boy-and-the-Heron/) (2023). The film received critical acclaim, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and the second non-English-language film, after Spirited Away, to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards. According to Studio Ghibli vice-president [Junichi Nishioka](https://anilist.co/staff/212700/Junichi-Nishioka) and long-time colleague, [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/Toshio-Suzuki), Miyazaki is reportedly working on another feature film, contrary to rumours that The Boy and the Heron would be his last.",

          "description": "Isao Takahata was a Japanese director, screenwriter, producer and one of the founders of [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/). Takahata earned international critical acclaim for his work as a director of anime films such as, [Grave of the Fireflies](https://anilist.co/anime/578/), [Only Yesterday](https://anilist.co/anime/1029/), [Pom Poko](https://anilist.co/anime/1030/), [My Neighbors the Yamadas](https://anilist.co/anime/415/) and [The Tale of the Princess Kaguya](https://anilist.co/anime/16664/).\n\nTakahata graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1959 with a degree in French literature. Around this time he had seen the French film The King and the Mockingbird, which led him to become interested in animation as a medium. A friend suggested for him to apply for a directing job at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/); Takahata passed their entrance exam, and was hired as an assistant director for several of Toei's works, including [Wolf Boy Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/17521/), on which he was mentored by [Yasuo Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/). Ootsuka eventually asked Takahata to direct a film of his own, thus he made his directorial debut in 1968 with the film [The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun](https://anilist.co/anime/1044/). A Toei employee named [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) served as a key animator in the film. Though it would later be recognized as one of the first defining works of modern Japanese animation, the film was a commercial failure, and Takahata was demoted.\n\nUnable to further improve his standing at Toei, Takahata left the studio in 1971, along with Miyazaki and [Youichi Kotabe](https://anilist.co/staff/115532/). Takahata and Miyazaki came up with the idea of creating an animated feature film based on the stories of Pippi Longstocking, and the duo had developed a number of storyboards and had flown out to Sweden for location shots and to meet with the books' author, [Astrid Lindgren](https://anilist.co/staff/140833/), and secure the rights for the character. However, they could not reach an agreement and were forced to drop the project. Takahata and Miyazaki remained collaborators in several other animation projects through the 1970s, including taking over production of the anime series [Lupin the Third](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/). \n\nNot long afterwards, Takahata, Kotabe, and Miyazaki were approached by the studio Zuiyo to create an animated series based on the novel Heidi, which resulted in [Heidi, Girl of the Alps](https://anilist.co/anime/2225/). Zuiyo later became [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/), which Takahata and Miyazaki joined. Takahata's work there included a World Masterpiece Theater adaptation of [Anne of Green Gables](https://anilist.co/anime/283/). Nearly a decade later around 1981, Takahata left Nippon to join [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/).\n\nConcurrent to these events, Miyazaki had made his own directorial debut in the Lupin III feature film [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/) in 1979, which was a critical success. Inspired by this, Miyazaki then began developing his own manga, [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/manga/30651/), and directing its 1984 [film adaption](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), which also was commercially and critically successful. Miyazaki then approached Takahata with the idea of co-founding their own animation studio based on the success of Nausicaä. And thus, Studio Ghibli was formed in 1985 by Miyazaki, Takahata, and Miyazaki's collaborators [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) and [Yasuyoshi Tokuma](https://anilist.co/staff/157040/).\n\nThe studio primarily released animated feature films that were directed by Miyazaki, with Takahata serving as producer or in other roles. Takahata also directed several Studio Ghibli films himself. His first, Grave of the Fireflies, released in 1988, was based on the semi-autobiographical short story of the same name written by Akiyuki Nosaka. Takahata was also partially inspired by his own experiences from the bombing of Okayama City, which he and his family had survived through back in 1945. The film received critical acclaim for its emotional impact and anti-war themes and is considered the film that established the international esteem of Studio Ghibli. Takahata went on to direct four more Ghibli films throughout his career. He was nominated for an Oscar in the category of Best Animated Feature Film at the 87th Academy Awards for The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.\n\nTakahata had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and died on April 5, 2018, at a hospital in Tokyo, at the age of 82. On May 15, 2018, a farewell ceremony for Takahata was held at the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. Hayao Miyazaki publicly spoke for the first time about Takahata's death, saying \"I was convinced that Paku-san [Takahata's nickname] would live to be 95 years old, but he unfortunately passed away. It makes me think my time is also limited... Thank you, Paku-san.\"\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/奥山玲子)\n\nReiko Okuyama was notable for being one of the first female animators in the anime industry.\n\nShe spent much of her early life confined to bed due to a series of illnesses, and developed her interest in drawing during this time. After the end of World War II, she entered mission school. After graduation, she entered Tohoku University as per her father's wishes, but she eventually dropped out and left her home town to work in Tokyo.\n\nIn 1957, Okuyama applied for a position at Toei Animation, mistakenly believing that they were publishers of children's books. Her drawing skills were enough for her to be hired as an in-betweener. Her first work was on the landmark feature film, [Panda and the Magic Serpent](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) in 1958. She was later promoted to 2nd key animator on [Magic Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/4948/), in spite of some sexual discrimination on the part of the studio heads. She was later promoted to key animator, and eventually to animation director.\n\nShe went freelance after briefly joining her husband [Youichi Kotabe](https://anilist.co/staff/115532/) at Nippon Animation. As a freelancer she worked as a printmaker, went on to illustrate several children's books and continued to teach animation at the Tokyo Designer Academy, which she had been doing since 1985.\n\nOkuyama passed away from pneumonia on May 6, 2007.",

After passing the test Ootsuka worked with [Yasuji Mori](https://anilist.co/staff/103602/) and [Akira Daikubara](https://anilist.co/staff/131868/) on the [Tale of the White Serpent](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and learnt their approaches. Wanting to learn more animation theory, he began to seek out textbooks and was shown a textbook on US animation written by Preston Blair. After working on [Magic Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/4948/) in 1959 his animation of a skeleton was unintentionally considered comical due to its realism. This led to comical bad guy characters becoming Ootsuka's speciality.\n\nOotsuka believed that genuine realism doesn't suit animation and \"constructed realism\" is more suitable. [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) compared Ootsuka to Kenichi Enomoto, a Japanese comedian, in the use of this approach. After completion of his next film [The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots](https://anilist.co/anime/2279/) Ootsuka left Toei to join [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/), then A Production.\n\nOotsuka wrote several books about the anime industry. His Sakuga Asemamire is considered \"a prime resource for the history of '60s and '70s anime.\"\n\nIn July 2002 an exhibition of his work and personal pieces was held in Ginza.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "__Residency:__ Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan\n__Graduated:__ Gakushuin University (Department of Economics)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, script/screenwriter, author, mangaka and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He is the second of four brothers, and was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyou Ward. He is best known for his international fame as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of astonishing animated feature films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\n\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014, as well as having won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature, the only instances in which a non-English-language film has won the award. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n__Biography:__\nMiyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, which led to him eventually joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation) in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with the director [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/Isao-Takahata). Some notable films Miyazaki contributed to at Toei include [Doggie March](https://anilist.co/anime/9228/Wan-Wan-Chuushingura/) and [Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/2833/Gullivers-Travels-Beyond-the-Moon/). He provided key animation in other films at Toei, such as the Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to animation studio A-Pro in 1971, where he would co-direct the movie Lupin the Third Part I alongside Isao Takahata. After moving to Zuiyou Eizou (later dubbed [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/Nippon-Animation)) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/Future-Boy-Conan/). He joined [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/Telecom-Animation-Film)/Tokyo Movie Shinsa in 1979 to direct his first feature films, [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/) in 1979 and [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/) in 1984, as well as the television series [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/Sherlock-Hound/).\n\nMiyazaki co-founded [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/Studio-Ghibli) in 1985. He would go on to direct numerous of films with Ghibli, including [Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/Castle-in-the-Sky/) (1986), [My Neighbor Totoro](https://anilist.co/anime/523/My-Neighbor-Totoro/) (1988), [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/Kikis-Delivery-Service/) (1989), and [Porco Rosso](https://anilist.co/anime/416/Porco-Rosso/) (1992). The films they made were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. His film [Princess Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/Princess-Mononoke/) was the first animated film to ever win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and it briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997, and its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Studio Ghibli's popularity and influence outside of Japan. His 2001 film [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/Spirited-Away/) became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films, [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/) (2004), [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/Ponyo/) (2008), and [The Wind Rises](https://anilist.co/anime/16662/The-Wind-Rises/) (2013) also enjoyed critical and commercial success.\n\nFollowing the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned again in 2016 to work on a new feature film, [The Boy and The Heron](https://anilist.co/anime/109979/The-Boy-and-the-Heron/) (2023). The film received critical acclaim, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and the second non-English-language film, after Spirited Away, to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards. According to Studio Ghibli vice-president [Junichi Nishioka](https://anilist.co/staff/212700/Junichi-Nishioka) and long-time colleague, [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/Toshio-Suzuki), Miyazaki is reportedly working on another feature film, contrary to rumours that The Boy and the Heron would be his last.",
