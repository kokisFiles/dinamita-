The film was only broadcast on television in some parts of the country, with occasional regional screenings. In 2015, after a successful crowdfunding campaign, the film eventually saw a theatrical release and the film was released on Blu-ray.</i>",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/885163337809395712)\n\nAn irreplaceable member of the Japanese animation industry.\n\nInoue is an animator of the realist school whose skills are among the best in the world. He is known to often handle immense amounts of work in the titles he partakes in. Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",

She was highly praised by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), who called her someone who he could trust to execute his vision.\n\nFutaki gained recognition as an animator for the cine-calligraphy style films she presented at the amateur PAF Animation Festival. At the beginning of her anime career she handled minor cuts on the projects she was assigned to, from Ghibli films to other feature projects with different studios. Her work on [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) received critical acclaim both nationally and internationally, and is what prompted Miyazaki to adopt her into Ghibli as a full-time staff member. She worked on nearly every single film the studio produced ever since then, with her final contribution being on [When Marnie Was There](https://anilist.co/anime/20555/) in 2014.\n\nShe expressed particular interest to nature and animals, which reflected in her animation style.\n\nFutaki was also one of three artists, along with [Miho Satake](https://anilist.co/staff/115148/) and Yuuko Shimizu, that provided illustrations for Moribito, a fantasy novel series by Japanese author [Nahoko Uehashi](https://anilist.co/staff/101325/).\n\nShe passed away from an unknown illness on May 13, 2016.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

After working for two years to save money for school, he entered Tokyo Designer Gakuin, a vocational school in Tokyo. He worked part-time in a gas station while attending the school. In 1979, he saw a [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/) recruitment advert in a magazine. He then applied to the studio, got hired, and subsequently dropped out of the vocational school.\n\nIn 1982, together with six colleagues, he established his own animation sub-contracting studio by the name Animaru Ya. By the mid '80s, Kigami had made a name for himself in the industry and was getting job offers straight to his name, which led him to working on film such as [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and [Grave of the Fireflies](https://anilist.co/anime/578/). In 1990, Kigami left Animaru Ya to take care of his mother in his hometown for a year.\n\nAfter his return to work he joined Kyoto Animation, and became a key factor in the to-be acclaimed animation studio's rapid growth throughout the years. Kigami mainly served as an animator during his career, but also directed, storyboarded and screenwrote numerous episodes and works for the studio. He was also involved in training young animators at the studio's training school.\n\nOn July 18, 2019, Kigami was tragically killed alongside 34 of his colleagues in the Kyoto Animation arson attack.",

His scenes being so lifelike that they’re often confused for rotoscoping. He draws characters with realistic proportions and weighty movement, and is a perfectionist in the minor details. He’s particularly skilled with busy crowd shots.\n\nMarried to voice actress [Sumi Mutou](https://anilist.co/staff/96118/).",
