  "description": "In most ways, Fujino is a typical high school student; his mind wanders during class, and he often finds himself lost in a daydream. But the odd thing about Fujino is that his daydreams are starting to revolve around a peculiar fetish for hands &ndash; specifically, the sleek, beautiful hands of his classmate and tutor, Takie. Hours spent admiring an attractive set of appendages is one thing, but Fujino is in for the shock of his life when a brush with Takie&rsquo;s hands gives him a literal jolt. What makes a current pass from Takie through every part of Fujino&rsquo;s body? How will Fujino&rsquo;s fellow students react when each accidental contact sends him skittering across the room?!<br><br>\n(Source: Dokidoki) ",
