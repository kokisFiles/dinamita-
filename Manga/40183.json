  "description": "Nothing could have thrilled Kimihiro more than stumbling upon the bizarre wish-granting shop of the beautiful but unnerving Y&ucirc;ko Ichihara, who solemnly promises to make the spirits plaguing Kimihiro go away just as soon as her fee&ndash;rendered in daily afternoon chores at her shop&ndash;is paid in full.<br><br>\nOf course, the thrill wears off as soon as Kimihiro realizes that his payment plan bears a disturbing resemblance to indentured servitude . . . eternal indentured servitude. Still he soldiers on, ready for whatever number of adventures lie ahead. But in Kimihiro&rsquo;s case, three may not be the charm!<br><br>\nHis first assignment&ndash;to procure a pair of fake eyeglasses&ndash;is exceptionally pointless, even by Y&ucirc;ko&rsquo;s standards. Or at least it seems that way, until Kimihiro watches a woman throw herself into traffic. He soon discovers that the doors of bespectacled perception can swing both ways.<br><br>\nNext, when a classmate seeks help solving a mystery involving text messages from the dead, Kimihiro is glad to play Sherlock. But he must turn to Y&ucirc;ko to determine whether the root of the riddle is otherworldly shenanigans, deceit, or murder.<br><br>\nFinally, however ready, willing, and able Kimihiro thinks he is to face the most unusual of circumstances, he still finds himself completely bewildered by the stranger who chases away his darkest spirits, condemns Y&ucirc;ko as a craven charlatan, and offers Kimihiro a way out of his preternatural predicament&ndash;and a fortune besides. <br><br>\n(Source: Del Rey)",

          "description": "[Website](http://www.clamp-net.com) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CLAMP_news) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clamp_4_official/)\n\nCLAMP is an all-female Japanese manga artist group that formed in the mid-1980s. It consists of leader [Nanase Ohkawa](https://anilist.co/staff/97292), and three artists who shift roles for each series: [Mokona](https://anilist.co/staff/100802) (もこな), [Tsubaki Nekoi](https://anilist.co/staff/100804), and Satsuki Igarashi (いがらし寒月). Almost 100 million CLAMP tankōbon copies have been sold worldwide as of October 2007.\n\nIn general, Ohkawa gets her inspiration for the group from everyday events such as dreams or the news. Unlike most manga artists who specialize in a single genre, CLAMP has created a diverse body of work. CLAMP's genres vary widely, from childish and comedic (<i>Cardcaptor Sakura, Clamp School Detectives</i>) to more dramatic and teen-rated (<i>xxxHolic, X</i>) series. Furthermore, drawing from the idea of Osamu Tezuka's <i>Star System</i> as they did in <i>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle</i>, CLAMP often crossover characters from their own series into their other works, which gives rise to a loosely defined \"Clamp Universe\".",
