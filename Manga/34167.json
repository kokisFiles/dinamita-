  "description": "Daizaburo Edi-Ban, a Japanese-American, joins New York City's toughest precinct, the 34th. On his first day he is partnered up with John Estes, called Sleepy by his friends and Mad Bull by his enemies, a cop who stops crime with his own violent brand of justice. Mad Bull makes no qualms about executing common thieves with shotgun blasts if they even pose a minor threat to him or anyone around them. Mad Bull also often steals from prostitutes and does incredible amounts of property damage while fighting crime. Mad Bull's unpoliceman-like behavior often puts him in hot water with his partner Daizaburo and the 34th precinct.<br><br>However, despite how reckless or illegal these acts are, a good cause is always revealed (For example, Sleepy uses the money he steals from the prostitutes to fund a venereal disease clinic and a home for battered and raped women). Perrine Valley, a police lieutenant, joins Daizaburo and Sleepy later on to help them tackle more difficult cases involving the mafia and drug-running.\nMad Bull 34 is inspired by the high-action buddy cop films of the 70's and 80's.\n",

          "description": "__Height__: 183 cm\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kazuo_Koike/)\n\nKoike was a prolific Japanese manga writer, novelist and entrepreneur. \n\nEarly in Koike's career, he studied under *Golgo 13* creator [Takao Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/97907/Takao-Saitou) and served as a writer on the series. \n\nKoike, along with artist Goseki Kojima, made the manga [Kozure Ookami](https://anilist.co/manga/30904/Kozure-Ookami/), and Koike also contributed to the scripts for the 1970s film adaptations of the series, which starred famous Japanese actor Tomisaburo Wakayama. Koike and Kojima became known as the \"Golden Duo\" because of the success of Kozure Ookami.  Another series written by Koike, [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/manga/31449/Crying-Freeman/), which was illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, was adapted into a 1995 live-action film by French director Christophe Gans.  Kazuo Koike started the Gekika Sonjuku, a college course meant to teach people how to be mangaka.\n\nIn addition to his more violent, action-oriented manga, Koike, an avid golfer, has also written golf manga.",
