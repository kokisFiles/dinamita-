          "description": "Affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/), where he currently serves as the chief of the ufotable Art Department.\n\nWith a career spanning over 50 years in the anime industry, Ebisawa is recognized as one of the longest-serving background artists. He made his debut in 1969, contributing to the art staff of [Himitsu no Akko-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/3285/Himitsu-no-Akkochan/). Over the years, Ebisawa freelanced for various studios, leaving his artistic mark on iconic scenes in productions like [Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone](https://anilist.co/anime/1435/Lupin-III-The-Secret-of-Mamo/), [Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/Macross-Do-You-Remember-Love/), and others.\n\nIn 1980, he took on the role of art director for [Cyborg 009: Legend of the Super Galaxy](https://anilist.co/anime/7336/Cyborg-009-Legend-of-the-Super-Galaxy/), initiating a career in art direction for theatrical and OVA productions. Despite his reluctance for the position, he continued to contribute to notable works. After a hiatus from the role, he returned as art director for [The Garden of Sinners: Chapter 4 – The Hollow Shrine](https://anilist.co/anime/4280/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-4-garannodou-The-Hollow-Shrine/) in 2008.\n\nEbisawa's unique approach includes hand-drawing backgrounds using traditional methods like paper, brushes, and poster colors, a style that distinguishes him in an era dominated by digital techniques. Notably, he personally handled the majority of cuts in The Garden of Sinners: Chapter 4 – The Hollow Shrine.\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 65, Ebisawa expanded his role by taking on the position of art director for the anime series [Today's Menu for the Emiya Family](https://anilist.co/anime/100855/Todays-Menu-for-the-Emiya-Family/). His contributions extend beyond individual projects, as he plays a crucial role in training new talents at ufotable, As part of the training program for new staff, they are obliged to work exclusively on hand-drawn background art using poster colors, similar to Ebisawa's style, for a certain period after joining the company. This practice aims to improve the drawing skills of the art staff, resulting in the inclusion of hand-drawn backgrounds in many ufotable works. Throughout his career, Ebisawa's dedication to the artistry of animation has left an indelible mark on the industry.",
