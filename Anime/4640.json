          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/oshii_mamoru)\n\nAn anime and live-action director, mostly known for the former, whose seminal titles include [Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer](https://anilist.co/anime/1921/), [Angel's Egg](https://anilist.co/anime/885/), the first two [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/1095/) films and the [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) films, as well as the Kerberos Saga universe of which [Jin-Roh](https://anilist.co/anime/570/) is a part.\n\nHis affinity for Euro arthouse cinema, his falling out with the Christian religion, and his fascination with the unsuccessful anti-occupation, pro-communist protest movement in postwar Japan shaped his unusual sensibilities. Recurring themes and aesthetics in his works include oppressive police states, unsuccessful protest movements, dysfunctional bureaucracies, political action that results in stasis, biblical scripture, and imagery, philosophical dilemmas, characters trapped in seemingly inescapable situations, the use of dialog as descriptive \"texture\" rather than a plot-driver, and otherwise Euro-arthouse pacing and storyboarding. He is both polarizing to mainstream audiences, and highly revered by cinephiles and Hollywood directors; his works have influenced Hollywood films such as Dark City, The Matrix, and Avatar.\n\n[Kenji Kamiyama](https://anilist.co/staff/100348/), an anime director also closely associated with [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), is his protégé.",

However, he dropped out after half a year. With a few friends, he created the band Muse, playing fusion rock and participating in music competitions.

While recording music for [Yuji Mitsuya](https://anilist.co/staff/95874/) he met music director Naoko Asari, who advised him to compose anime soundtracks.

He contributed music to horror films: Ring, Ring 2, Dark Water, Japanese-Polish science-fiction film Avalon and the Hong Kong film Seven Swords.\n\nFor the music found in Seven Swords and A Battle of Wits he was nominated for Best Original Film Score Awards at both the 25th and 26th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2006 and 2007.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
