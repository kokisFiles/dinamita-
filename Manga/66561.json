          "description": "[Official website](http://dengekibunko.jp/author/kamachikazuma/index.html) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kamachi_ka)\n\nKazuma Kamachi is a Japanese light novel author and the original creator of the Toaru Majutsu no Index light novel series and its spin-off manga series, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun and Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator.\n\nAs he uses a pen name, his real name and identity is as of yet unknown.\n\nBefore becoming the famous writer of the Index light novel series, Kamachi wrote a story entitled Schrödinger's City (シュレディンガーの街 Shuredingā no Machi?) as an entry in the  9th Dengeki Game Novel Prize; unfortunately, his submission failed to reach past the third selection stage of the said competition. However, his story caught the attention of the editor-in-chief of Dengeki, and Kamachi later became in-charge in writing the book Kaite-minai ka? (書いてみないか？? lit., Want to Try Writing?), which became his debut as a professional writer.\n\nKamachi began writing novels while he was still studying as a junior high school student. However, his works were not finished until he graduated from high school.",
