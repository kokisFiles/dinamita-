  "description": "When the Emperor takes a new Empress, she is barely older than the Emperor's son Hikaru. She becomes both the one woman Hikaru loves and the one woman he can never have. And so Hikaru's feelings roam as his body wanders from bed to bed, seeking a replacement for her. When he finds the girl he believes can take her place... he commits a terrible sin. Now, a thousand years later, Hikaru's nightmares become reality as he is punished for past deeds in a new life -- the greatest playboy in all of history... shakes like a lamb when any girl touches him! <br><br>\nThis manga is loosely based on \"The Tale of Genji\" (\"Genji Monogatari\").",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/紫式部) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murasaki_Shikibu)\n\nMurasaki Shikibu (973 or 978 - 1014 or 1031) was a Japanese novelist, poet and lady-in-waiting at the Imperial court during the Heian period. She is best known as the author of The Tale of Genji, widely considered to be one of the world's first novels, written in Japanese between about 1000 and 1012.\n\nMurasaki wrote The Diary of Lady Murasaki, a volume of poetry, and The Tale of Genji. Within a decade of its completion, Genji was distributed throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century her work was translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to recognize the importance of her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
