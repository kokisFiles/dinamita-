          "description": "Miyazawa was born in what is now Hanamaki city, Iwate Prefecture as the eldest son of a wealthy pawnbroker. From an early age, he was disturbed by what he perceived to be the social inequity between his well-to-do family and the impoverished farmers in the area from whom his family profited by lending them money.\n\nFrom 1926 until his death from pneumonia in 1933, Miyazawa struggled to improve the material and spiritual life of the impoverished peasants of his native Iwate. He introduced new agricultural techniques and new varieties of seeds. He left his position as instructor at Hanamaki Agriculture School in 1926 to establish the Rasu Farmers Association. At the detached house of his family, where he was staying at the time, he gathered a group of youths from nearby farming families and lectured on agronomy. The association also engaged in plays, music, and other cultural activities.\n\nHis writings from this period show sensitivity for the land and for the people who work in it. A prolific writer of children's stories, many that appear superficially to be light or humorous, all contain stories intended for moral education of the reader. He wrote some works in prose and some stage plays for his students and left behind a large amount of tanka and free verse, most of which was discovered and published posthumously. His poetry, which has been translated into numerous languages, has a considerable following to this day. A number of his children’s works have been made into animated movies (anime) in Japan.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

While doing both of these, he continued to work on his dream job of working on movie production. He acted as the coach for the nine-member volleyball team at Toshiba. Dezaki also began pulling together an anime production team.\n\nDezaki resigned after working for seven years at Toshiba, leaving Hosei University in the middle of a term as well. He began working for [Gisaburou Sugii's](https://anilist.co/staff/103537) company Art Fresh, working alongside his younger brother [Osamu](https://anilist.co/staff/100393). His first works included writing the script for [Attack No.1](https://anilist.co/anime/1550) and storyboarding [Kyojin no Hoshi](https://anilist.co/anime/5834).\n\nIn 1969, Dezaki became a freelancer, doing scripting, production and direction work for [Tokyo Movie Shinsha](https://anilist.co/studio/65), [Tatsunoko Production](https://anilist.co/studio/103), and [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14). In 1977, he founded [Magic Bus](https://anilist.co/studio/207) and produced and animated [Shin Kyojin no Hoshi](https://anilist.co/anime/15875).\n\nHe is the older brother of [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393), and the husband of [Setsuko Shibuichi](https://anilist.co/staff/101935/).",
