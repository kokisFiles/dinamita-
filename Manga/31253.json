  "description": "Kyon is an ordinary freshman high school student who, self-admittedly, has given up his fantasies of espers, time travelers, and aliens as he left middle school. However, sitting behind him is the beautiful, intelligent, and eccentric girl Haruhi Suzumiya, who in her class introduction blatantly states her singular desire in meeting aliens, time travelers, sliders, or espers. Interested, Kyon starts trying to make small talk with her before class, eventually leading to normal conversations with Haruhi. One day, after making a comment about Haruhi's displeasure with the available school clubs, he finds himself dragged into membership of the newly formed Spreading Excitement All Over the World with the Haruhi Suzumiya (or SOS) Brigade.<br><br>\nThis is the first of two manga adaptations of the light novel series. Both manga adaptations were published in Sh&#333;nen Ace, but the earlier one (this one) was canceled after the first volume. The reasons for this stem from the fact that the manga was considerably different from the novel and had little input from the original author. <br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Nagaru is a Japanese author, best known as the creator of the [Suzumiya Haruhi series](https://anilist.co/manga/33083/Suzumiya-Haruhi-Series/). \n\nIn high school, he was part of an art club but would also visit a literary club once a week. He graduated from the Faculty of Law in Kwansei Gakuin University. After graduating from university, he became a manager at a women's clothing store but decided to quit to pursue a writing career.\n\nHe would spend time being unemployed and reading books at the library, until he made his debut in March 2003 with his novel \"Dengeki!! Aegis 5\" in the magazine \"Dengeki Moeou\". That same year, two of his other novels [Escape From School!](https://anilist.co/manga/40275/Gakkou-wo-Deyou/) and [The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi](https://anilist.co/manga/33083/Suzumiya-Haruhi-Series/) were released, with The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi winning the Sneaker Taisho literary prize.\n\nHis work is strongly influenced by the science fiction novels he read while in middle school. He has mentioned that authors who influenced him in particular were [Hideyuki Kikuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97323/Hideyuki-Kikuchi/), [Baku Yumemakura](https://anilist.co/staff/97026/Baku-Yumemakura/), [Ellery Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellery_Queen), [Van Dine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._S._Van_Dine), [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov), as well as the director of [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/Urusei-Yatsura/), [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/Mamoru-Oshii/).",
