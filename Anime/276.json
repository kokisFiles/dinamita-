  "description": "Vesper is a secret agency fighting an army of alien invaders by using super-powerful battle androids. Mahoro is Vesper's most powerful battle android and has won many battles, but she has little operating time left and soon will cease to function. However, if she lays down her arms and conserves her remaining power, the time she has left can be prolonged to just over a year. Mahoro is given an opportunity to live the remaining time she has as a normal human. She chooses to live as a maid for Suguru, a phenomenally messy high school student who lives by himself after his family passed away.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "[Twitter (shiimai)](https://twitter.com/shiimai) | [Sakugabooru](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=hiroyuki_imaishi+) \n\nHiroyuki Imaishi was born in 1971, in Tokyo. He joined studio Gainax after graduating from Tama University of Arts. Imaishi later left the studio to establish his own studio, Trigger, where he still works to this day.\n\nImaishi made a name for himself on *Hideaki Anno*'s [Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/). He did key animation and storyboards for several episodes, with episode 19 being a standout for its unorthodox paper cutout animation. His presence injected some stylized levity into Anno's shoujo drama.\n\nImaishi started as an animator heavily influenced by [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/Masahito-Yamashita) and [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada). He draws \nwith a similar warping of perspective and with characters snapping into discrete poses, mixed with cartoony devices reminiscent of A Pro's work on [Dokonjo Gaeru](https://anilist.co/anime/5618/Dokonjou-Gaeru/), of which Imaishi is a fan. He also tends to draw his characters enveloped in speedlines, with strongly defined eyes and eyebrows, rectangular jawlines, and gummy, gritted teeth. His cuts are willfully limited, eliminating transitions between poses and using fast looping for comedic effect.\n\nImaishi became one of Gainax' premier directors after Kare Kano. His directorial aesthetic is heavily informed by his animation. Elisions of graphic space become elisions of cinematic space and time.The interplay of moving and still planes, forceful use of text, and extreme variations in size are other major components of his direction. His shot compositions are usually very busy due to crunching in as much of his characters into the frame as possible, and he has no problem reducing action scenes to pure visual abstraction, like rendering clashing figures as a few pencil lines. He is known to employ [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki)-esque tricks like triple takes and postcard shots in his work. His storyboards are rough, improvised, and lacking in detail. He's a fan of American director [Robert Rodriguez](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/) and [John Woo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/), and loves referencing classic anime and film in his works.\n\nHis first solo directorial effort was the Production I.G. OVA [Dead Leaves](https://anilist.co/anime/974/Dead-Leaves/) which would set the stage for Imaishi's later works: crude, anarchic, and heterogeneous characters positioned against a homogenizing totalitarian force. Dead Leaves uses pillarboxing and text in a manner recalling stylized comic books. Imaishi served as character designer and animation director on the OVA so the animation is steeped in his neo-Kamada idiom more than any of his other works.\n\nImaishi left Gainax and formed studio Trigger with [Masahiko Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/Masahiko-Ootsuka) in 2011, bringing over several major animators to the new studio. His debut TV work with Trigger was 2013's [Kill la Kill](https://anilist.co/anime/18679/Kill-la-Kill/), that similarly to Gurren Lagann, freely and extensively referenced anime history. Despite being a broadly popular series overseas, it is Imaishi's most controversial work to date, not only for its extreme levels of fanservice, but also because it suffered damaging production problems: rewrites of the script, cost cutting animation shortcuts, and a restrictive schedule. \n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/hiroyuki-imaishi/)",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/吉成曜) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoh_Yoshinari) | [Sakugabooru](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=yoh_yoshinari)\n\nA Japanese animator, director and storyboard artist currently working at [Trigger](https://anilist.co/studio/803/). Yoshinari entered the anime industry through the influence of his older brother, [Kou Yoshinari](https://anilist.co/staff/102136/). Several of his early works were uncredited second key animation and in-betweens for his brother during high school. After leaving professional school, he applied to [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/) and [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/). Not receiving a response from Gainax, he joined Madhouse. Due to a misunderstanding, Gainax failed to process his application until three months later. Not wanting to explain, Yoshinari told Madhouse; \"being an animator is too hard for me,\" and switched to Gainax.\n\nAt Gainax, Yoshinari had joined just after the closure of [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). With nothing to do, he was immediately put onto visual development for the film [Aoki Uru](https://anilist.co/anime/21430/), although the film’s production was later broken off due to the studio’s financial state. Undoubtedly his breakout as an animator was just a few years later when he served as one of the lead animators in [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/). Yoshinari worked at Gainax until leaving for Trigger in 2011, a studio founded by fellow ex-Gainax members, [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/) and [Masahiko Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/). At Trigger he debuted as a director on [Little Witch Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/14349/).\n\nYoshinari is recognized by the way he represents volume and perspective using spheres, especially for smoke and explosions, as well as his character action in general. His characters often borrow traits from western animation, such as rectangular heads, low contrast shading, big eyes and angular lineart. He uses expertly timed smears, dramatic camerawork, and complicated background animation to convey dynamism. His movement is springy and tense, cleanly situated in the dominant cartoony style of ‘00s Gainax. He remarks [Nijitte Monogatari](https://anilist.co/manga/112385/) as one of his most important influences, with his artistic style particularly visible in his design work for [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/) and Little Witch Academia.\n\nAlso a big fan of [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/)’s, having done multiple short [animations](https://anilist.co/anime/123638/) based on his manga characters.\n\nMarried to producer [Naoko Tsutsumi](https://anilist.co/staff/150017/).\n\n(Sources: Wikipedia, Anidb, Animators Wiki)",

He was inspired to enter the field because he liked [Hidenori Matsubara](https://anilist.co/staff/107672/) and [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/)'s drawings.\n\nHis first major role was serving as character animation director for [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/Gunbuster-2-Diebuster/), with the task of adapting [Yoshiyuki Sadamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/98158/Yoshiyuki-Sadamoto)'s character designs for animation. This experience led him to become one of the main character designers at the studio, designing the iconic characters for [Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/).\n\nHe left Gainax to have his debut as director on [The Idolm@ster](https://anilist.co/anime/10278/The-Idol-Master/), a personal passion project since he's a great fan of the series. Several Gainax staff followed Nishigori to [A-1 Pictures](https://anilist.co/studio/561/) and worked on the series, alongside staff from newly formed [Trigger](https://anilist.co/studio/803/Trigger).\n\nIn 2018 he directed his original project [Darling in the Franxx](https://anilist.co/anime/99423/), once again reuniting with his Gainax friends spread among [CloverWorks](https://anilist.co/studio/6222/), Trigger and [Studio Khara](https://anilist.co/studio/47/).\n\nMore recently he worked as character designer and chief animation director for [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/)'s final Evangelion installment, [Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon A Time](https://anilist.co/anime/3786/Evangelion-3010-Thrice-Upon-A-Time/).",

The film was directed by Mamoru Hosoda, which led to Kubota getting an invite to join the production of [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/) as an animation director.
