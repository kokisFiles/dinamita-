  "description": "Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura return as the fun-loving but broke members of the Yorozuya team! Living in an alternate-reality Edo, where swords are prohibited and alien overlords have conquered Japan, they try to thrive on doing whatever work they can get their hands on. However, Shinpachi and Kagura still haven't been paid... Does Gin-chan really spend all that cash playing pachinko?\n\nMeanwhile, when Gintoki drunkenly staggers home one night, an alien spaceship crashes nearby. A fatally injured crew member emerges from the ship and gives Gintoki a strange, clock-shaped device, warning him that it is incredibly powerful and must be safeguarded. Mistaking it for his alarm clock, Gintoki proceeds to smash the device the next morning and suddenly discovers that the world outside his apartment has come to a standstill. With Kagura and Shinpachi at his side, he sets off to get the device fixed; though, as usual, nothing is ever that simple for the Yorozuya team.\n\nFilled with tongue-in-cheek humor and moments of heartfelt emotion, Gintama's fourth season finds Gintoki and his friends facing both their most hilarious misadventures and most dangerous crises yet.\n\n<br></br>(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

          "description": "Hideaki Sorachi (空知英秋, Sorachi Hideaki) is a Japanese manga artist best known for his work Gintama.\n\nAccording to his reply to a manga reader (Gintama Volume 11), he was quite interested in manga during childhood days. However at grade 4 in school he showed his work to his father who promptly laughed at it, after which Sorachi temporarily abandoned his aims of being a manga artist. After graduation, he could not find a job, thus he turned to drawing manga (which he had already learned in university). He was able to gain some recognition through his first work Dandylion and subsequently progressed in his career (the comic is shown in the first volume of Gintama, with a foreword by Hideaki stating that it was his first work). \n\nIn 2003, Sorachi's editor attempted to coax him to create a new series due to a new television program on the Shinsengumi airing on Japanese TV the next year. Yet Sorachi's original idea was to ride on the coattails of the Harry Potter franchise with a series about a school for demon dispellers. After several arguments and an attempt to write the Shinsengumi series, Sorachi gave up, took what he had of the script and twisted it to become the pseudo-historical science fiction series Gintama. (stated in Gintama Volume 1)    \n\nHideaki Sorachi holds a degree in commercial advertising (again, stated in volume 11). \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The response on the album were not as expected, and the members of the band instead called it \"The Dark Ages\". After that, they went on a split tour with the bands ircle and SUPER BEAVER, and said that occasional advice from both of the bands was a large help to escape the \"dark age\" as they called it.\n\nOn April 11, 2012, the 2nd mini album \"HALO EFFECT\" was released. The title song \"HALO\" has helped increase the number of YouTube views, and the number of live shows started piling in for them as a band.\n\nOn November, 2013, they released a split album titled \"BONEDS\" with the bands [MY FIRST STORY](https://anilist.co/staff/127675/My-First-Story), AIR SWELL and [SWANKY DANK](https://anilist.co/staff/132868/SWANKY-DANK).\n\nOn September 10, 2014, they made a major debut under Ki/oon Music with their EP titled \"TIMELESS ROOKIE\", this is also when they left their previous record label titled 美音 (Mio).\n\nOn October 9, 2016, the band made had their first one-man live show held at the Nippon Budokan.

The guitarist [Oji](https://anilist.co/staff/148135) (Kaizoku Ou), the illustrators Rocoru (in 2013) and [Mogelatte](https://anilist.co/staff/121589/Mogelatte), the video producer Ziro and the pianist [cake](https://anilist.co/staff/147555) (the latter three joining in May 2014) are also part of the group as support members. Later on they acquired the drummer Nakanishi in 2017. However, Rocoru graduated from the group in 2019.\n\nSome of their most popular songs include \"Suki Kirai\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\" and \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\". Their music style consists mostly of positive rocky songs.\n\nIn January 2014 they had their first major debut, with the album \"<i>Zutto Maekara Suki Deshita</i>.\", which ranked in fourth place on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon\">Oricon</a>. In May 2014, the start-up of \"<i>CHiCO with HoneyWorks</i>\" was announced. Sometime in early 2019, the circle began to include subunits: s×c, a duo comprised of shito and cake; and HoneyMonster, comprised of Gom (Kouto), cake, and Nakanishi. The circle also created a number of fictional idols, such as LIP×LIP and Dolce.\n\nIn addition, ten light novels, based on the <a href=\"https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Confession_Executive_Committee_Love_Series\">Confession Executive Committee Love Series</a> songs \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\", \"Yakimochi no Kotae\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\", \"Ima ni Suki Naru.\", \"Koi-Iro ni Sake\", \"Kinyoubi no Ohayou\", \"Heart no Shuchou\", \"Ijiwaru na Deai\", \"Boku ga Namae wo Yobu Hi\", and \"Daikirai na Hazu Datta.\" have been released so far. A short novella about the song \"Watashi, Idol Sengen\" was also included with a CHiCO with Honeyworks album. Light novels for HoneyWorks' other songs do exist as well; the Love and Hate Trilogy (\"Nakimushi Kareshi\", \"Suki-Kirai\", \"Hajimari no Sayonara\") and \"Sekai wa Koi ni Ochiteiru\" and its sequel \"Koi no Chord\" both received one.",
