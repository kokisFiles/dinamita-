  "description": "A young high school couple out on a date saw what looked like a falling meteorite, and inside, they discovered a little baby girl! The two of them married and adopted the girl, who they named Morumo, as their own. The only problem with this feel-good story is that now, as a high school freshman, Morumo is 16.4 meters tall!<br><br>\nMorumo still has a pretty happy life. She's popular with locals and tourists alike, and she goes to school everyday with her childhood friend Miharu. Then one day, a mad scientist, who specializes in experimenting on young ladies, injects Morumo with a serum that reduces her to 1/10 of her normal size. Her weight remains the same, so she is super-dense and tough like a superhero. Suddenly, it seems like all the joys of an ordinary life are within her grasp!! Sadly, the serum's effects are temporary and soon Morumo returns to her giant state.<br><br>\nBut now that she knows a normal life is possible, Morumo is not going to give up! Even if it means she and Miharu have to allow a mad scientist to experiment on her, surely the ends will be worth the means!",
