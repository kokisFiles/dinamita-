Koike and Kojima became known as the \"Golden Duo\" because of the success of Kozure Ookami.  Another series written by Koike, [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/manga/31449/Crying-Freeman/), which was illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, was adapted into a 1995 live-action film by French director Christophe Gans.  Kazuo Koike started the Gekika Sonjuku, a college course meant to teach people how to be mangaka.\n\nIn addition to his more violent, action-oriented manga, Koike, an avid golfer, has also written golf manga.",

His illustrations adorned a huge amount of books and record covers. He liked it to break existing tabus, e.g. in 1972 he created a scandal with \"Dousei Jidai\" (showing a swinging cohabitation of a unmarried couple). In the 70's and 80's he established oneself as drawer for demanding adult Manga (Gekiga). He was very productive, he drew approximate 400 pages per month. On January the 11th 1986 he died of a tumour in his pharynx.",
