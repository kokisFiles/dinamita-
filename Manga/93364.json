When he’s only eleven, however, his peerless fingers fall silent—right up there on stage.\n<br><br>\nExploring the shock of the incident and its aftermath from his friends and rivals’ perspectives, A Six-Person Etude accompanies the boy’s halting efforts to pick himself up as an adolescent.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
