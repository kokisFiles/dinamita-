  "description": "At seven years old, Ryuji's yakuza parents were murdered in front of him, leaving him so traumatized that he erased the memories from his mind and started living with his new mother, his biological aunt. At seventeen years old, Ryuji comes home one day to find his unknown past had caught up to him. While ten years ago his mind protected him by forgetting, now his body protects him by fighting blindly until nothing was left but dead bodies, pools of blood, and... his little brother Tomoya. What further hell awaits him in prison...?<br><br>\n(Source: Futekiya)",

Today she is one of the most popular Boys' Love authors.  Her doujinshi circle is called K2 Company. Since she got her start doing shonen manga, she was embarassed to write under her real name, so she wrote under \"Kazuma\", which is a man's name, but she decided to keep it when she started writing female-oriented stories.",
