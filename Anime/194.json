He developed this further in the extremely fluid and active full animation of [Tobe! Kujira no Peek](https://anilist.co/anime/2314/). Gosenzo was the first anime to place shadows accurately according to light source and to use blurring during fast action. His way of animating arms hanging loosely was often imitated in the ‘90s. Utsunomiya draws movement from memory without external references, whereas animators like [Oohira](https://anilist.co/staff/103893/) and  [Hashimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/103894/) often filmed themselves acting out material for reference. Kinetic accuracy is the goal but drawings are highly simplified and clean.\n\nSimplified style of animation and detailed action makes his scenes stand out in stark contrast in certain films such as [Battle Royal High School](https://anilist.co/anime/3625/). Able to breathe a miraculous amount of life into the simplest of actions such as simply talking while seated. Reportedly storyboarded the third episode of [The Hakkenden: Shin Shou](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/) in widescreen format on his own initiative. Able to create dynamic action at lower frame rates like 3 frames/cel. His more current work focuses on the subtle, unconscious movements of everyday actions, omitted as superfluous in supposedly 'realistic' animation.\n\n(Source: Pelleas)",

          "description": "Ichirou Itano is a Japanese director, producer, animator and mechanical designer. He has worked in a number of science fiction anime series, especially mecha-themed ones. Director of works such as [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/), [Battle Royal High School](https://anilist.co/anime/3625/), [Gantz](https://anilist.co/anime/384/) and more.\n\nItano is best known among anime fans for a style of action scene that he developed, usually nicknamed \"Itano Circus\" by fans; it refers to a highly stylized and acrobatic method of depicting aerial combat and dogfights in many anime.\n\nThe production in [Space Runaway Ideon](https://anilist.co/anime/930/) became a hot topic in the anime industry, and it came to be called this by comparing the brisk movement of mechanics to the air acrobatics of the circus. The technique became more famous when Itano used it for the \"dogfights\" depicted in [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) anime TV series in 1982. It's characterized by detailed, fluid shading of the mecha, the close-range acrobatic moves the dueling fighters make in combat, as well as twisting contrails left by fighters and missiles. It is also commonly used in specific reference to an attack where a mecha or spaceship launches a large swarm of guided missiles with meticulously animated spiraling smoke trails and erratic trajectories and its target is repeatedly dodging those missiles at a high speed.\n\nAccording to him, [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), [Masami Gotou](https://anilist.co/staff/129865/) and [Yasushi Muraki](https://anilist.co/staff/105090/) are the only animators to have fully mastered Itano Circus.",
