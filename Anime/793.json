  "description": "Yuuko receives a letter from an unknown sender. It is an invitation to an auction. Seven avid collectors were invited to an old mansion. They all admit that they accepted the invitation to complete their collections. They waited for the host, but he does not make an appearance. And one by one the collectors disappear. The strange host and a mysterious girl. A night where odd things happen one after another. What is being auctioned? Who is the host? The cunning and foolish people who are obsessed with \"possessions\" and the host's \"timeless\" passion. What is waiting at the end of this enigmatic series of riddles? And what is the conclusion of the sad love story behind them? Mystery leads to mystery, and reaches the unexpected!<br><br>\n(Source: Production I.G.)",

It consists of leader [Nanase Ohkawa](https://anilist.co/staff/97292), and three artists who shift roles for each series: [Mokona](https://anilist.co/staff/100802) (もこな), [Tsubaki Nekoi](https://anilist.co/staff/100804), and Satsuki Igarashi (いがらし寒月). Almost 100 million CLAMP tankōbon copies have been sold worldwide as of October 2007.\n\nIn general, Ohkawa gets her inspiration for the group from everyday events such as dreams or the news. Unlike most manga artists who specialize in a single genre, CLAMP has created a diverse body of work. CLAMP's genres vary widely, from childish and comedic (<i>Cardcaptor Sakura, Clamp School Detectives</i>) to more dramatic and teen-rated (<i>xxxHolic, X</i>) series. Furthermore, drawing from the idea of Osamu Tezuka's <i>Star System</i> as they did in <i>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle</i>, CLAMP often crossover characters from their own series into their other works, which gives rise to a loosely defined \"Clamp Universe\".",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nocturamayama)\n\nYamashita graduated from Kokugakuin University with a Major in History. He first started out in the industry in 1997 as a production assistant at JCF. Amazingly, he has never been formally trained in art. His talent for drawing was first discovered through various doodles and sketches he would make on company paperwork.\n\nYamashita's first project as an animator was on [the second Kochikame movie](https://anilist.co/anime/3547/). Some time later he went freelance. [Samurai Champloo](https://anilist.co/anime/205/) was the first project he worked on freelance. Around 2006, Yamashita joined [Bee Train](https://anilist.co/studio/5/) and started work as character designer and animation director on the TV show [Ginyuu Mokushiroku Meine Liebe Wieder](https://anilist.co/anime/771/). A short while later, the animation department at Bee Train was spun off into new company, [C-Station](https://anilist.co/studio/6074/), and Yamashita moved with it. Today he retains a seat at C-Station, but regularly contracts out to work on various external projects.",
