  "description": "Tamako knows just about everything there is to know about mochi, the traditional Japanese dessert treats. When she's not attending her first year of high school, she even invents new flavors and varieties for Tama-ya, her family's mochi shop. School and growing up, on the other hand, are some things that she's still trying to find the right recipe for. But with the help of her best friends Kanna and Midori, two girls whose parents run businesses in the same shopping district, Tamako's determined to make the best of things. It's complicated though, especially when it comes to emotions and her relationship with her best boy friend Mochizou, whose family runs a rival mochi shop. And lately, Midori's been feeling a little odd about her feelings towards Tamako as well. And what's with up with that strange bird fluttering around, the one that speaks fluent Japanese? It's all very mysterious and overwhelming, but at least Tamako always has one thing she can count on: No matter if your day's been good or bad, there's certain to be something sugary and delicious waiting at the end of every adventure whenever you take a walk through Tamako Market!<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

          "description": "__Height:__ 175 cm (5'9\")\n\nKeiji Fujiwara was a Japanese actor and voice actor.\n\nEven though he was born in Tokyo, he spent the majority of his childhood in Iwate Prefecture. In high school, he handled vocals in a band he formed with his friend Kotaro Furuichi, future guitarist of rock band The Collectors.\n\nAt around 18 years of age, he moved back to Tokyo on his own and joined the Bungakuza acting school. He spent the 1980s performing in several theater troupes while working odd jobs. Fujiwara was introduced to his first voice acting agency, Ken Production, in the early 1990s. The first TV anime in which he appeared as a regular was [Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi](https://anilist.co/anime/970/), but his breakout role was [Hiroshi Nohara](https://anilist.co/character/33466/) in [Crayon Shin-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/966/).\n\nIn November 2006, he left Ken Production and founded his own agency, Air Agency. Aside from talent management, the company went on to release original drama and situation CDs through its child company Air Label, as well as produce live events. In 2010, Fujiwara made his own sound directorial debut in Kakkokawaii Sengen.\n\nIn August 2016, Air Agency announced that he was going on hiatus in order to undergo medical treatment for a then-unspecified illness. He officially resumed work in June 2017. On April 16, 2020, Air Agency announced that Fujiwara had passed away due to cancer on April 12, 2020.\n\n__Trivia:__\n- He was a regular lecturer at the Japan Newart College since 2008\n- In the live action field, he was most known for dubbing actor Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man/Tony Stark.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

After working for two years to save money for school, he entered Tokyo Designer Gakuin, a vocational school in Tokyo. He worked part-time in a gas station while attending the school. In 1979, he saw a [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/) recruitment advert in a magazine. He then applied to the studio, got hired, and subsequently dropped out of the vocational school.\n\nIn 1982, together with six colleagues, he established his own animation sub-contracting studio by the name Animaru Ya. By the mid '80s, Kigami had made a name for himself in the industry and was getting job offers straight to his name, which led him to working on film such as [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and [Grave of the Fireflies](https://anilist.co/anime/578/).

She worked at [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) from 2004 to 2020. \n\nYamada enjoyed drawing as a child and would copy images from the [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/) and [Dragon Ball](https://anilist.co/anime/223/) series. She joined the volleyball club in primary school and the tennis and photography clubs in high school. At the Kyoto University of Art and Design, she studied oil painting and was a member of the special effects club. She intended to work in film after university, but instead decided to join Kyoto Animation after seeing an advertisement. Her first assignment at the studio was drawing in between frames for [Inuyasha](https://anilist.co/anime/249/), which Kyoto Animation helped produce. She was eventually promoted to a key animator for [Air](https://anilist.co/anime/101/).\n\nAfter working as an episode director of [Clannad](https://anilist.co/anime/2167/), she was asked to make her chief directorial debut with [K-ON!](https://anilist.co/anime/5680/), an adaptation of a slice-of-life manga. The series was very successful, spurring a second season and a film. In 2013, she directed [Tamako Market](https://anilist.co/anime/16417/), and followed it with the film [Tamako Love Story](https://anilist.co/anime/20519/) in 2014. For Tamako Love Story, she was awarded the New Face Award at the Japan Media Arts Festival. She storyboarded the entire film herself, and also wrote the lyrics for the opening theme song, “Everybody Loves Somebody.”\n\nYamada's next project was the feature film [A Silent Voice](https://anilist.co/anime/20954/), an adaptation of [Yoshitoki Ooima](https://anilist.co/staff/105951/)’s manga by the same name. The film reflected on elements of bullying and physical impairment in Japan. The film opened at #2 in the Japanese Box Office and grossed a total of ¥2.3 billion (~$21.7m USD), the 19th highest-grossing film in Japan in 2016. The film also received multiple award nominations, including Best Animation Film in the Mainichi Film Awards and the Excellent Animation of the Year in the Japan Academy Prize.\n\nFor Yamada, the most important part of being a director is to observe people. She describes herself as a \"method\" director, emphasizing the minds of the characters.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

His works span the transition from the classical period to the romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his \"middle\" period showed an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as \"heroic.\" During this time, he began to suffer increasingly from deafness. In his \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She started as inbetweener on Shin-Chan, before making a debut as key animator on the KyoAni in-house OVA Munto. In 2007 she was given the chance to design characters for the anime adaptation of the Lucky Star yon-koma manga.\n\nHoriguchi is particularly known for the shape she gives her drawings, resulting in a certain roundness and the distinctly fine outline and peculiar shading. Her characters appear to be very child-like and cute, and full of energy, which is a major appeal to the fans.\n\nThe illustrator [BUNBUN](https://anilist.co/staff/112785) is her younger brother.",
