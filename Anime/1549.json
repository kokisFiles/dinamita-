  "description": "AD 1999, the Earth was in a critical situation; a planet Lar Metal was approaching to the Earth. Meanwhile, Yukino Yayoi was heard about Lar Metal from Dr. Amamori of Tokyo Observatory. She was a junior high school teacher, but she also worked for Dr. Amamori who appreciated her astronomical knowledge. Actually Yukino Yayoi was Queen Millennia who had come from Lar Metal 1000 years before, and she had been watching human beings since then.<br><br>\nSoon, numerous meteors fell on the Earth, and people were in panic. In this catastrophe, Hajime, who was a student of Yayoi, came to help Yayoi. Yayoi invited him into a big cave under the ground.<br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

          "description": "A highly prolific and an extremely influential animator.\n\nKnow for his experimentation with the timing of keyframes, his dynamic poses, and his peculiar effects Kanada pioneered a number of techniques and concepts that permeated and shaped the Japanese animation industry, influencing not only his peers but also the generations to come.\n\nKanada's ability and his tendency to be very personal with his drawings, even to the point of ignoring storyboards if the situation required, popularized in the industry the concept of letting the individual animator's talents shine instead of being uniformed into anonymity. This precept is still respected today and it's one of the reasons Japanese animation is so distinctly unique.

In 1999, he worked on Castlevania 64 and made the character illustrations for the game. Umetsu released [Mezzo Forte](https://anilist.co/anime/221/) in 2000, [Mezzo](https://anilist.co/anime/222/) in 2004 and [Kite Liberator](https://anilist.co/anime/3323/) in 2008. In 2009, Umetsu had several projects on his hands, most notably an anime film titled [Kiss and Cry](https://anilist.co/anime/101704/). The film took nearly five years to complete.",
