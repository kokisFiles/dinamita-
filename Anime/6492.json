  "description": "It is said that train stations are not only an end and a beginning for many, but also are a place for lost and forgotten objects &ndash; and for those who are forgotten. On a rain-soaked day, Minky Momo rides the train towards her final destination and ends up conversing with an old man who is trying to reunite with someone very important to him. After discovering he left his passport on the train, Momo embarks to try to find him and consequently runs into both her parallel self, and a young girl who is in need of both of their help. She has ties to the station, and yearns to find a resolution to her troubles...<br><br>\n(Source: Anime-Planet)",

Subsequently he became the character designer for the later OVAs.\n\nIn 1986 he made his debut as director on [Kyoushoku Soukou Guyver](https://anilist.co/anime/2293/). Following some more work as animator he switched to directing in the beginning of the '90s. He is nowadays affiliated with [Studio Deen](https://anilist.co/studio/37/).",

          "description": "As is the case with many Japanese artists, her privacy was well guarded; little is known about her life apart from her artistic career. \n\nDuring the 90s, she continued singing and also wrote for anime voice actors. From 2000, she became involved in earnest with anime and composed several songs for Wedding Peach, Fruits Basket and Love Hina. She formed the duo Melocure in 2002 with singer-songwriter Megumi Hinata, and in the following two years, the duo released several singles and an album, Melodic Hard Cure. Okazaki also produced songs during these years for artists such as Megumi Hayashibara, Mayumi Iizuka, and Yui Horie.  Her work consists mainly of ballads, and can be categorised within the spectrum of Japanese music as most closely related to J-Pop. According to her fans, the lyrics of Okazaki's songs are characterized by poetic imagery, depth of emotion, gentle optimism and simplicity.  \n\nOn May 5, 2004, Ritsuko Okazaki died suddenly at the age of 44 from septic shock as a result of septicemia. She was unable to speak any last words, and left her work unfinished. ",
