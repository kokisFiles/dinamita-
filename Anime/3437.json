Subsequently he became the character designer for the later OVAs.\n\nIn 1986 he made his debut as director on [Kyoushoku Soukou Guyver](https://anilist.co/anime/2293/).

After the closing of Atorie, he worked for other studios such as Project Team Muu and Fenx before going freelancer. He serves as character designer, animation director and animator on countless anime series and contributes to a monthly comic strip to Newtype magazine.\n\nHe has been an animator since he graduated from high school at 18. Unlike most other animators Gotou had never gone to an art school. He became interested in animation after seeing an advertisement in an animation magazine saying that animators were needed. Without having any connections within the industry he went on and joined Atelier Giga and studied there for a year under [Akihiko Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/103299/) before marking his debut as animator on [Mister Ajikko](https://anilist.co/anime/3437/).\n\nIn 1988 Studio Atelier declared bancrupcy and he went to Project Team Muu, which later became Phoenix Entertainment. His first work there was as animator on Anime Sanjushi. When working on the Yuusha Saga, he met Ishida Atsuko on Densetsu no Yuusha Da Garn, who influenced Gotou in his character design, particularly the design of the eyes. Together with the experience from training under Yamashita Akihiko this influence resulted in Gotou's so called \"gocky picture\" later.\n\nHe made his debut as character designer on Choujin Densetsu Urotsukidouji 4 and his debut as series director on Kiddy Grade.\n\nMarried to [Megumi Kadonosono](https://anilist.co/staff/100963/).\n\n(Source: Anidb)",

This precept is still respected today and it's one of the reasons Japanese animation is so distinctly unique. His career is also a testament to his ethos that expressive and vibrant animation is not achieved simply through increasing the number of frames but through playing with movement, poses and timing.\n\nIn the early '00s, Kanada became an employee at Square Enix.\n\nNotable Square Enix titles in which he was credited:\n\n~!\n- 2002, Final Fantasy XI (Motion Capture, Animation Director)\n- 2005, Musashiden II: Blade Master (Storyboard)\n- 2006, Dawn of Mana (Facial Setting)\n- 2007, Final Fantasy 4 DS Version (Storyboard)\n- 2009, Final Fantasy XIII (Storyboard Director) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2011, Final Fantasy XIII-2 (Storyboard) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2012, Dragon Quest X (Storyboard)  - *Posthumous credit.* !~",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/kojimorimoto) | [Website](http://www.kojimorimoto.com)\n\nFan of anime such as [Lupin the 3rd](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/Lupin-the-3rd/) and [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/Future-Boy-Conan/), after graduating from the Osaka Designers' college, he joined [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE) and soon after Studio [Annapuru](https://anilist.co/studio/583/Annapuru). He wanted to work with esteemed Director [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki) since [Gamba's Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/Gambas-Adventure/) was particularly striking to him.\n\nInterested in effects animation, he cites [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada) and [Kazuhide Tomonaga](https://anilist.co/staff/110219/Kazuhide-Tomonaga) as major influences. He had his first breakthrough as animator on [Space Adventure Cobra](https://anilist.co/anime/2451/Space-Adventure-Cobra/) and [Golgo 13: The Professional](https://anilist.co/anime/1760/), in which his effects work and fun character animation was highly praised. Later his work became increasingly more experimental, combining his animation with intricate art design and CGI.\n\nDuring his period at Annapuru he befriended [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/Takashi-Nakamura) and the two worked on several projects together even after leaving the studio. [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Ootomo) recognized his talent and Morimoto became a key figure in many of his works. He debuted as Director on [Robot Carnival](https://anilist.co/anime/2182/Robot-Carnival/).\n\nIn 1985 he founded [Studio 4°C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/) alongside former Ghibli producer [Eiko Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/103607/Tanaka-Eiko). He would later leave the studio in 2011.\n\nMarried to [Atsuko Fukushima](https://anilist.co/staff/118789/).",
