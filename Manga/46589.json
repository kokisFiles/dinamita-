  "description": "When high school student Souji Kushiki, an academic achiever and talented athlete from a well-to-do family, returns home from boarding school, he finds that his sisters Harumi, Youko, and Saki have changed. Their strangely clingy behavior borders on the inappropriate and bizarre, yet Souji just brushes off their odd behavior at first.<br><br>\nHowever, when Souji arrives at school the next day, he learns that, during the summer, one of the students in his class was pushed to his death in front of a subway train. And what's more, two other students were stabbed by an unknown culprit. Are the victims linked, and could Souji's sisters have anything to do with the murders?<br><br>\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

          "description": "Nagaru is a Japanese author, best known as the creator of the [Suzumiya Haruhi series](https://anilist.co/manga/33083/Suzumiya-Haruhi-Series/). \n\nIn high school, he was part of an art club but would also visit a literary club once a week. He graduated from the Faculty of Law in Kwansei Gakuin University. After graduating from university, he became a manager at a women's clothing store but decided to quit to pursue a writing career.\n\nHe would spend time being unemployed and reading books at the library, until he made his debut in March 2003 with his novel \"Dengeki!! Aegis 5\" in the magazine \"Dengeki Moeou\". That same year, two of his other novels [Escape From School!](https://anilist.co/manga/40275/Gakkou-wo-Deyou/) and [The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi](https://anilist.co/manga/33083/Suzumiya-Haruhi-Series/) were released, with The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi winning the Sneaker Taisho literary prize.\n\nHis work is strongly influenced by the science fiction novels he read while in middle school. He has mentioned that authors who influenced him in particular were [Hideyuki Kikuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97323/Hideyuki-Kikuchi/), [Baku Yumemakura](https://anilist.co/staff/97026/Baku-Yumemakura/), [Ellery Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellery_Queen), [Van Dine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._S._Van_Dine), [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov), as well as the director of [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/Urusei-Yatsura/), [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/Mamoru-Oshii/).",
