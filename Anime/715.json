Older brother of [You Yoshinari](https://anilist.co/staff/102998/).\n\nHe is known for having reached great expertise in many techniques from realistic animation to digital compositing. This gives him the ability to have full control over his works, often being responsible for the key frames, in-betweens, finishing, photography and backgrounds of the scenes he is in charge of.\n\nHis skilled use of coloring and compositing, together with the realistic depiction of movement make his works to be often mistaken for computer generated animation.\n\n**Notable works outside anime:**\n~!\n- Ghost in the Shell (Video Game, 1997) (OP Key Animation)\n- Tales of Phantasia (Video Game, 1998) (Cutscene Director, Animation Director, Key Animation)\n- Valkyrie Profile Series (Video Game, 1999-2008) (Character Design, Art Design) \n- Kafu ~Kono Shirabe ga Kimi ni Todokimasu You ni~ (Visual Novel, 2001) (OP Key Animation, In-between Animation, Background Art, Digital Paint, Photography, CG Animation)\n- Sakura Wars 3: Paris is Burning?
