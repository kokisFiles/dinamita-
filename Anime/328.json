  "description": "When Miu was young, she was fascinated by the piano and took up lessons.<br><br>\nWhen the show opens, Miu is in middle school. She is shy, a softspoken girl who doesn't have a lot of confidence in herself. Her friends would describe her as &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; and &ldquo;quiet.&rdquo; At this point, Miu has been taking piano lessons for some time and while people have told her that she's gotten very good over the years, Miu herself feels she's not really good at anything &ndash; including the piano. Her teacher, Mr. Shirakawa, is often frustrated with her playing. Although she plays every note exactly correct, her heart just isn't in it&hellip;<br><br>\nMeanwhile, Miu's come of the age when she's noticing boys and this shy young lady has noticed the handsome Kazuya Takahashi &ndash; even if he hasn't noticed her.<br><br>\nThis is Miu's story. The story of a young girl who is on a journey to discover the melody within her own heart and the courage to express it. &nbsp;<br><br>\n(Source: RightStuf)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fujishimakosuke)\n\nKosuke Fujishima is a Japanese manga artist.\n\nHe first came to public attention as an editor of Puff magazine, his first job after completing high school. Fujishima originally intended to be a draftsman, but took the editorial role after failing to get a drafting apprenticeship. He later became assistant to manga artist [Tatsuya Egawa](https://anilist.co/staff/98034/Tatsuya-Egawa) in the production of the Making Be Free! manga, and in 1986 began his first original manga series You're Under Arrest. His second manga series Oh My Goddess!, also translated as Ah! My Goddess, is Fujishima's most famous work, which made him a household name in Japan. He is also well known as the character designer for several games in the Tales series and Sakura Wars.\n\nHe is known for his love of automobiles and motorcycles, and several of his series and their characters reflect this, such as in éX-Driver and Oh My Goddess!.\n\nOn June 29, 2016, the famous 20-year-old cosplayer Nekomu Otogi announced her marriage to Fujishima as well as her pregnancy on her Twitter page. On July 7, 2016, Fujishima confirmed the marriage on his Twitter account.",
