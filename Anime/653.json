Soon after, at the age of 19, he got his first major break when he landed the role of mecha designer on [Dancouga: Super Beast Machine God](https://anilist.co/anime/2255/). Not too long after, at the young age of 21, he was given his first directorial role by directing episodes 5 and 6 of the [Bubblegum Crisis](https://anilist.co/anime/1347/) OVA series. \n\nOobari mainly likes to work within the sci-fi mecha and fighting genres. His designs are easily recognizable from the voluptuous female forms and well-toned pretty boys he tends to create to appeal to wide audiences. For references, he likes to use images of professional wrestlers and models. He is friends with fellow former animator and current freelance illustrator [Tsukasa Kotoboki](https://anilist.co/staff/97965/).\n\nHe wasn't originally interested in animation but was inspired by [Satoshi Urushihara](https://anilist.co/staff/98177/).",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
