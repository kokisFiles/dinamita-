  "description": "Ichigo Kurosaki is a rather normal high school student apart from the fact he has the ability to see ghosts. This ability never impacted his life in a major way until the day he encounters the Shinigami Kuchiki Rukia, who saves him and his family's lives from a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that devours human souls. \n<br><br>\nWounded during the fight against the Hollow, Rukia chooses the only option available to defeat the monster and passes her Shinigami powers to Ichigo. Now forced to act as a substitute until Rukia recovers, Ichigo hunts down the Hollows that plague his town. \n\n\n",

So far, he has released three singles and most recently a mini-album. His first sinlge \"Baby It's You\" was used as the ninth ending theme for the anime Bleach. His second single \"Pride of Tomorrow\" was the second ending theme for the anime D.Gray-Man.  June first began singing in his second year of intermediate school. After his friends told him he was not good at singing, he practiced for two years until, finally, during his first year of high school, he was able to move his friends to tears with his singing.  At the age of 17, June recorded a cover of Musiq's \"Love\". This song reached Matsuo \"KC\" Kiyoshi, a well-known R&amp;B producer, who then flew to Korea to meet June. June studied Japanese for a year to prepare, and then he made his major debut under SONY in November of 2006 at the age of 19.",
