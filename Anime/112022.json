          "description": "__Age:__ 16\n__Height:__ 158 cm (5'2\")\n<br>\nThe first Japanese VOCALOID to be both developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media, Inc.. She was initially released in August 2007 for the VOCALOID2 engine and was the first member of the Character Vocal Series, as well as the seventh VOCALOID overall and the second VOCALOID2 vocal released to be released for the engine. Her voice is provided by the Japanese voice actress [Saki Fujita](https://anilist.co/staff/95504/Saki-Fujita).\n\nThere have since been numerous installments, such as additional voice libraries dubbed 'Append', as well as an upgrade for the VOCALOID3 engine, which contained an English vocal release. She received a VOCALOID4 update to her Japanese and English voicebanks in August 2016, as well as a Mandarin Chinese voicebank in September 2017.\n\nMiku is considered the most popular and well known Vocaloid and the first to become a pop idol. The name of the title and the character of the software were chosen by combining Hatsu (初, first), Ne (音, sound), and Miku (未来, future) thus meaning \"the first sound from the future.\" Her name was based on her concept of that when a sound is first spoken.\n\nWhen KEI illustrated Miku, he was given a color scheme to work with (based on the YAMAHA synthesizers' signature blue-green colour) and was asked to draw Miku as an android. Crypton also provided KEI with Miku's detailed concepts, however, Crypton said it was not easy to explain what a \"Vocaloid\" was to him. KEI said he could not create an image of a \"singing computer\" at first, as he did not even know what a \"synthesizer\" was. It took him more than a month to complete the commission. ",

He (along with his counterpart, Rin) is the second set of vocals for Crypton's Character Vocal Series and are both Character Voice VOCALOIDs. During their Append's production, Wataru Sasaki (aka. Wat) described Rin & Len as two bodies with one soul. \nHe has had numerous installments since such as additional voice banks dubbed 'Append', an update to the VOCALOID4 engine, and an English vocal. \n\nWhen the Kagamines were being recorded in 2007, their names were not yet decided. Their given names of Rin and Len were said to be based on \"right\" and \"left\" according to Asami Shimoda. She later confirmed in an interview after the Append release that the names were based on Ken and Rin from Hokuto no Ken, derived from a discussion about names that were familiar from her childhood.\nTheir surname was derived from the developing code combining Kagami (鏡, mirror) and Ne (音, sound). This refers to an \"echo\", which is a sound being bounced back to the user from a different direction caused by sound waves hitting a surface in a direction that reflects it back the way it came.\n\nTheir codename of \"CV02\" means \"Character Voice 02\".\n\nTheir voices are provided by the Japanese voice actress, stage actress, and singer [Asami Shimoda](https://anilist.co/staff/96696).\n\nVoicebanks:\n~!Power (V2 & V4)\nCold (V2 & V4)\nSerious (V2 & V4)\nEnglish (V4)!~",
