  "description": "The fourth son of the famous Caluanthes family is, well, quite infamous. Mockingly referred to as a bird of paradise, Fourth dresses gaudily, spends money like water, and has turned the trip he's been sent on to learn more about the world into his own personal gourmet dining tour. His behavior makes the rest of high society whisper about him behind his back. The only exception is Eiri Lawrence, who finds Fourth and his entourage intriguing rather than laughable - and who is everything that Fourth is not. Theirs is the world of high society, where truth and falsehood, and dark and light, intertwine.\n",

          "description": "__Tools:__ IllustStudio, Cintiq 13HD\n\n[Twitter](http://twitter.com/moyasshi) | [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/users/1101)\n\nHer older sister introduced her to manga by showing Aki the comics she drew and later buying her a Saint Seiya doujinshi. She became a mangaka mainly because of her father's and sister's influences, both of whom she said are fans of anime and manga. She grew up surrounded by anime such as Doraemon, which is largely due to her father's interest in anime.\n\nAfter being introduced to the Saint Seiya doujinshi, she became interested in doujinshi of other series, such as Gundam Wing. In 2000, she started up her own doujinshi circle, Shachou no Subako (a Gensou Suikoden centered circle (though, it recently began releasing doujinshi for other series as well, such as Tales of Zestiria and Road to Dragons). Later, in 2006, she published her first series, Utahime, in Libre Shuppan's Kurofune Zero.\n\nIn addition to being a mangaka, Aki also illustrates light novels.\n\n(Source: Aki's long interview in Haruca)\n\nShe owns a dog which she affectionately calls \"furball.\"",
