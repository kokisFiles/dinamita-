The guitarist [Oji](https://anilist.co/staff/148135) (Kaizoku Ou), the illustrators Rocoru (in 2013) and [Mogelatte](https://anilist.co/staff/121589/Mogelatte), the video producer Ziro and the pianist [cake](https://anilist.co/staff/147555) (the latter three joining in May 2014) are also part of the group as support members. Later on they acquired the drummer Nakanishi in 2017. However, Rocoru graduated from the group in 2019.\n\nSome of their most popular songs include \"Suki Kirai\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\" and \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\". Their music style consists mostly of positive rocky songs.\n\nIn January 2014 they had their first major debut, with the album \"<i>Zutto Maekara Suki Deshita</i>.\", which ranked in fourth place on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon\">Oricon</a>. In May 2014, the start-up of \"<i>CHiCO with HoneyWorks</i>\" was announced. Sometime in early 2019, the circle began to include subunits: s×c, a duo comprised of shito and cake; and HoneyMonster, comprised of Gom (Kouto), cake, and Nakanishi. The circle also created a number of fictional idols, such as LIP×LIP and Dolce.\n\nIn addition, ten light novels, based on the <a href=\"https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Confession_Executive_Committee_Love_Series\">Confession Executive Committee Love Series</a> songs \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\", \"Yakimochi no Kotae\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\", \"Ima ni Suki Naru.\", \"Koi-Iro ni Sake\", \"Kinyoubi no Ohayou\", \"Heart no Shuchou\", \"Ijiwaru na Deai\", \"Boku ga Namae wo Yobu Hi\", and \"Daikirai na Hazu Datta.\" have been released so far. A short novella about the song \"Watashi, Idol Sengen\" was also included with a CHiCO with Honeyworks album.

In 1983 he left and established Studio Fuga together with Kouji Oono and [Toshiharu Mizutani](https://anilist.co/staff/121908/Toshiharu-Mizutani). There he eventually left as well and formed his own 'Ogura Kobo' at Production I.G., where he trains newer art directors. He continues to be a major presence at Production I.G. as one of their most prominent art directors.\n\nOgura's style is, similar to Kobayashi's, rooted in imposing architecture, ambient colors, and Western perspectives versus traditional Japanese isometric perspectives. Ogura's backgrounds are usually urban in setting and has a less saturated color palette, and uses more cool than warm colors. Ogura's fantastical, European Kobayashi influence is easily seen in [Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/Ouritsu-Uchuugun-Honneamise-no-Tsubasa/), and his later work has remained distinctly metropolitan, something that can be seen even in the rural [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/).\n",
