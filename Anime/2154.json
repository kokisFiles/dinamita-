He wanted to work with esteemed Director [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki) since [Gamba's Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/Gambas-Adventure/) was particularly striking to him.\n\nInterested in effects animation, he cites [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada) and [Kazuhide Tomonaga](https://anilist.co/staff/110219/Kazuhide-Tomonaga) as major influences. He had his first breakthrough as animator on [Space Adventure Cobra](https://anilist.co/anime/2451/Space-Adventure-Cobra/) and [Golgo 13: The Professional](https://anilist.co/anime/1760/), in which his effects work and fun character animation was highly praised. Later his work became increasingly more experimental, combining his animation with intricate art design and CGI.\n\nDuring his period at Annapuru he befriended [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/Takashi-Nakamura) and the two worked on several projects together even after leaving the studio. [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Ootomo) recognized his talent and Morimoto became a key figure in many of his works.

          "description": "Michael Arias, born 1968 in California, is an award-winning filmmaker, spanning the worlds of live-action storytelling, visual effects, computer graphics, and anime. He graduated from the Webb School of California at age 16 and attended Wesleyan University in Connecticut, before eventually dropping out to pursue a career in the film industry.\n\nArias got his start at Dream Quest Images, working as a camera assistant on the motion control stages of effect-heavy films such as The Abyss (1989) and Total Recall (1990). In 1990, Arias was asked by visual effects godfather Douglas Trumbull to program ride vehicle motion for [Back to the Future...The Ride](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101392/), which is considered a milestone in immersive entertainment. He then moved to Tokyo for stints at post-production behemoth Imagica and game giant Sega, until returning to the United States to co-found effects boutique Syzygy Digital Cinema.\n\nAt CG innovator Softimage, Arias developed and patented tools for combining traditional animation and computer graphics, working closely with Studio Ghibli to add a distinct visual flavor to Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. In 2000, Arias arranged Studio 4C to produce [The Animatrix](https://anilist.co/anime/1303/Animatrix/), which subsequently broke home-video record sales and won numerous awards. Arias had since become [Eiko Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/103607/Eiko-Tanaka)'s right hand man.\n\nIn the wake of his The Animatrix success, he was given the prestigious role of Chief Director of [Tekkon Kinkreet](https://anilist.co/anime/2154/Tekkon-Kinkreet) (2005), after [Kouji Morimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100066/Kouji-Morimoto) abandoned the project. With this, Arias became the first non-Japanese director of a major anime film, which attracted much attention during the initial screenings of the film.\n\nHis approach to the film was unorthodox; storyboarding duties were broken up on a scene-by-scene basis, with many of the film's major animators directing their own scenes. Another unique quality Arias brought to the production was the simulated handheld camera effects that suffuse the film, a creative decision he maintained despite protests from art director [Shinji Kimura](https://anilist.co/staff/100373/Shinji-Kimura). Arias' short for [Ani*Kuri15](https://anilist.co/anime/2832/AniKuri15/) also featured subtle rocking of the frame, erratic depth of field, and other handheld film artifices. \n\nArias is an active member of the Visual Effects Society, and has co-authored papers for and, at one time or another, served as guest editor, presenter, panelist, and juror for ACM/Siggraph. He is also a frequent writer on Japanese culture, animation, and manga.\n\nsources: [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0034712/) | [camonte](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/michael-arias/)",

His animation style includes using exaggerating motion, manipulating gravity and balance with use of different perspective shots, lots of rapid camera movement and unconventional angles. With his boldly distorted and vigorous drawing style, his cuts are unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nHe has worked as an animator for over thirty years. His early work in the 80's mainly consisted of action and effects cuts. He bounced around several studios, including [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and [Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/). His early cuts include [Gall Force 2: Destruction](https://anilist.co/anime/2061/), for which he animated a laser beam with a distinctly loose and vivid sense of movement. With its smooth animation and wavy motion pattern, the cut has a lively fluidity to it that can be seen as the first step towards Oohira's current distinctive visuality. He used the same approach on his smoke effects for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) and a flood for [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/). His style truly came into fruition when he started applying this to solid objects – especially people. The earliest such case is his cut in the fourth episode in [The Hakkenden: Shin Shou](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/). The Oohira \"wobble,\" is perhaps his most distinct trademark: the animated objects expand and compress in a wobbling manner.\n\nAspired to become an animator after having seen [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/)'s work on [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/).\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\n",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/170696565)\n\nShiotani grew up admiring Ghibli films and Ghost in the Shell, so he decided to enroll in an animation school in order to be able to participate in the creating process of anime. After graduating he joined [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/) becoming one of their most promising young animators. \n\nAfter some years spent climbing to the position of animation director on series such as [Windy Tales](https://anilist.co/anime/1524/Windy-Tales/), he left his first creative mark on the industry by directing, storyboarding and supervising [Blood+](https://anilist.co/anime/150/)'s kaleidoscopic 3rd Opening. \n\nHe had his directorial debut with [Tokyo Marble Chocolate](https://anilist.co/anime/3088/), OVA produced as a collaboration between Production I.G. and BMG Japan in commemoration of both companies' 20th anniversaries. The OVA was awarded the Grand Prize in the Feature Film Category of the 12th Seoul International Cartoon & Animation Festival in 2008.\n\nShiotani is most famous for being the director of the [Psycho-Pass](https://anilist.co/anime/13601/) series. Initially planned with a post-apocalyptic setting, the concept changed after the Great East Japan Earthquake and evolved into its final form. The series is inspired by detective crime stories and sci-fi (Minority Report, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Patlabor) with the precise intent of exploring societal problems. \n\n",
