  "description": "One day Pop was out scavenging with Hana, and found a beautiful rose inside the Queen's garden. Curious, she picked the rose and brought it home. Unwittingly, that rose can cause all wishes to become true, whether good or bad. Good wishes will turn the rose white and bloom, while bad wishes will turn the rose black and wither. After a heated argument with her sister Doremi, Pop wishes that Doremi loses all her magic and be turned into a mouse. Hilarity ensues, as Doremi and the others try to put everything back to normal.<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",
