  "description": "Mireille Bouquet is a professional assassin, and a very good one at that. But when she follows up an e-mail from a young Japanese girl named Yumura Kirika, inviting her to take \"a pilgrimage to the past\", her life becomes even more dangerous than it already is. Now, with a haunting melody invoking the memory of an event long past, Mireille and Kirika decide to work together to find the truth about a thousand year old organization that has controlled both of their lives since before they were born. And the only clue in their search, the only thing Kirika remembers about herself, becomes their working codename: a name designating an ancient fate, of two maidens who reign over death--Noir. <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Her father was a big fan of classical and opera music and always desired for Yuki to play the piano for him. Yuki eventually gained a love for music and a love for the piano. Yuki started out as an SE programmer, but changed to music in 1992. She made her grand debut with a female trio called \"[See-Saw](https://anilist.co/staff/104342).\"  In the years to come the group released six singles and two albums. \n\nYuki then went on to work on her solo career composing for artists and some TV, films, and games, such as _Blood: The Last Vampire_ in 2001, and _Xenosaga II_ and _III_. In 2001, Yuki's claim to fame came with the release of the anime [_NOIR_](https://anilist.co/anime/272). The soundtrack sold 50,000 copies. In 2002, she was brought on to project .hack to write the score to [_.hack//SIGN_](https://anilist.co/anime/48), along with vocalist [Chiaki Ishikawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101059) and New York singer [Emily Bindiger](https://anilist.co/staff/103845). Shortly after Yuki comprised an album of original and complied songs known as Fiction, working again with Emily Bindiger as well as _Xenosaga_ vocalist Deb Lyons.  \n\nYuki's other well-known works were for [_Mobile Suite Gundam Seed_](https://anilist.co/anime/93), which hit 5th on the Oricon Charts its first week, and selling over 200,000 copies. Yuki has also become known for her work on CLAMP's [_Tsubasa Chronicle_](https://anilist.co/anime/177) series, [movie](https://anilist.co/anime/807), and [OVAs](https://anilist.co/anime/2685). In 2003, she formed the project [FictionJunction](https://anilist.co/staff/103691) in which pairs Yuki's songwriting and composition with different performing vocalists, first as separate solo works and later into a singular group. In 2007, Yuki formed the band [Kalafina](https://anilist.co/staff/101975), with two partners from FictionJunction, Wakana Ootaki and [Keiko Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/104664), to perform for the anime [_Kara no Kyoukai_](https://anilist.co/anime/2593), further working on several others. Kalafina disbanded in 2018, with their final lineup including Wakana, Keiko, and [Hikaru](https://anilist.co/staff/168857).",

However, the sound has changed in recent times to take on a darker and more mysterious tone. Takarano Arika, lead singer/lyricist, has termed this change as a transition from White Alice (白アリ) to Black Alice (黒アリ). Though there has been a general shift towards performing songs in the \"Black Alice\" phase, Ali Project has occasionally sung in the White Alice style as well.\n \nIn 1988 they made their indie debut in the chartsas Ari (Ant) Project (蟻プロジェクト) with their album Fantastic Garden (幻想庭園 Gensou Teien). The album was later included in Tatsumi Takayuki's book Philosophy of Progressive Rock (プログレッシヴ・ロックの哲学), which led to the band being classified under the progressive rock genre. Four years later in 1992 they changed their name and made their major debut with their single \"Fall in love, maiden\" (恋せよ乙女 Koi-seyo otome).\n\nMost of their records are released by Toshiba-EMI, Victor Entertainment and Tokuma Japan. The band is notable in the anime community for having their songs featured in several anime opening and ending sequences, most notably the series Noir and Rozen Maiden.\n\n<b>Members</b>\n- [Arika Takarano](https://anilist.co/staff/101307/Arika-Takarano) (宝野アリカ) - vocals, lyrics\n- [Mikiya Katakura](https://anilist.co/staff/101309/Mikiya-Katakura) (片倉三起也) - music, arrangement\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
