          "description": "Shotaro Ishinomori was an influential figure in manga, anime and tokusatsu who created several immensely popular long-running series such as Cyborg 009, what would go on to become the Super Sentai series and the Kamen Rider Series. He was twice awarded by the Shogakukan Manga Award, in 1968 for Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae and in 1988 for Hotel and Manga Nihon Keizai Nyumon. He was born and named <b>Shotaro Onodera</b> (小野寺 章太郎) in Tome, Miyagi, and was also known as Shotaro Ishimori (石森 章太郎) before 1986, when he changed his family name to Ishinomori with \"ノ\".  \n\nCyborg 009, created in 1963, became the first superpowered hero team created in Japan. That same year, Kazumasa Hirai and Jiro Kuwata created Japan's first cyborg superhero, 8 Man (which predated Kamen Rider by eight years). The success of the tokusatsu superhero TV series Kamen Rider, produced by Toei Company Ltd. in 1971, led to the birth of the \"Transforming\" (henshin) superhero (human-sized superheroes who transform by doing a pose, and use martial arts to fight henchmen and the weekly monster), and resulted in many sequel shows to this day. Ishinomori then created many similar superhero dramas, which were once again all produced by Toei or in Sarutobi Ecchan's case Toei Animation, including Android Kikaider , Henshin Ninja Arashi, Inazuman, Robotto Keiji, Secret Task Force Goranger (the first Super Sentai series), Kaiketsu Zubat, Akumaizer 3, Sarutobi Ecchan, the Toei Fushigi Comedy Series and countless others. He even created popular children's shows such as Hoshi no Ko Chobin (Chobin, Child of the Stars, 1974, a co-production with Studio Zero which was a major success on Italian television), and Ganbare!! Robokon.    \n\nIshinomori's art is quite reminiscent of that of his mentor, Osamu Tezuka. The true story of his first meeting with Tezuka was illustrated in a short four-page tale drawn up as supplementary material for the 1970s Astro Boy manga reprints. Around 1955, Ishinomori submitted work to a contest seeking new talent in the magazine, Manga Shonen. Tezuka was impressed by his drawings and asked Ishinomori to help him with Astro Boy. In the American release, this story can be seen in Volume 15, along with Ishinomori's earliest work on the \"Electro\" story arc.    \n\nIshinomori also illustrated a comic adaptation of the Super NES video game The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, which was produced for the American publication Nintendo Power. The comic consisted of 12 chapters, which were serialized from January 1992 (Volume 32) to December 1992 (Volume 43). The comic was republished as a graphic novel collection in 1993.  Ishinomori died of heart failure on January 28, 1998 just 3 days after his 60th birthday. His final work was the tokusatsu superhero TV series, Voicelugger, televised a year later. Two years later, the Kamen Rider Series would be revived with Kamen Rider Kuuga. All of the series made in the Heisei period credit Ishinomori as the creator. The Ishinomori Manga Museum named in his honor opened in Ishinomaki, Miyagi in 2001.[2] Special trains in the Senseki Line were commissioned featuring his artwork generally leading to the museum.    \n\nHis work posthumously awarded him the Guinness World Record for most comics published by one author, totaling over 128,000 pages.  \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)          ",

He was animation director and character designer for both the television and film incarnations of Cyborg 009 and animated the OP. He served a similar role on Rainbow Sentai Robin. Kimura’s masterpiece was his character designs and animation direction on Toei’s breakthrough wrestling series Tiger Mask. Kimura personally animated the OP and was AD on a number of episodes (1, 7, 11, 21, 27, 36, 49, 51, 58, 64, 71, 82). His drawings were inspired by the bold, expressionistic movie poster illustrations of Bob Peak.\n\nFollowing Tiger Mask, Kimura animated for a number of major 70s anime. He was often typecasted for OPs, like those he did for Atack No. 1 and Gatchaman. He was also a regular animator on the first Lupin III TV anime. After leaving Toei he formed his own subcontracting studio Neo Media and spent most of his career from the 80s onward training younger animators, though he still animates from time to time.\n\nRecently participated in a kickstarter, Go Samurai, which intends to make a short film out of Kimura’s uncorrected B&W pencil drawings.\n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/keiichiro-kimura/)",

Even in his earliest drawings, Kimura was extremely idiosyncratic: his lineart was rough and sketchy, but at the same time he paid more attention to human anatomy than all of his peers. Kimura’s cuts stood out for their rawness and epitomized the tendency in early TV anime towards highly stylized individual drawings in lieu of full animation.\n\nA staple of Toei’s early experiments in TV animation. He was animation director and character designer for both the television and film incarnations of Cyborg 009 and animated the OP. He served a similar role on Rainbow Sentai Robin. Kimura’s masterpiece was his character designs and animation direction on Toei’s breakthrough wrestling series Tiger Mask. Kimura personally animated the OP and was AD on a number of episodes (1, 7, 11, 21, 27, 36, 49, 51, 58, 64, 71, 82). His drawings were inspired by the bold, expressionistic movie poster illustrations of Bob Peak.\n\nFollowing Tiger Mask, Kimura animated for a number of major 70s anime. He was often typecasted for OPs, like those he did for Atack No. 1 and Gatchaman. He was also a regular animator on the first Lupin III TV anime. After leaving Toei he formed his own subcontracting studio Neo Media and spent most of his career from the 80s onward training younger animators, though he still animates from time to time.\n\nRecently participated in a kickstarter, Go Samurai, which intends to make a short film out of Kimura’s uncorrected B&W pencil drawings.\n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/keiichiro-kimura/)",

          "description": "Legendary sakuga animator critical to the development of Japanese TV animation. No less than Yoshinori Kanada and Masaaki Yuasa have cited him as an influence.\n\nDidn’t fit the nerdy animator stereotype in his youth. Growing up Kimura was known as a tough guy, bulky and confrontational. However, he loved painting as a hobby and when he couldn’t get into his art college of choice he joined Toei as an animator.
