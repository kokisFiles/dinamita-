  "description": "Cat Soup is an extremely difficult film to describe, due to its awesome surrealism and almost nonexistant dialogue. It is more a work of art than an anime. There are many underlying themes, such as the transcience of man's existence, but it can be enjoyed without understanding any of them. The plot, though simple, isn't necessarily understandable without being explained. The main character, a cat named Nyatto, embarks upon a journey to save his sister's soul, which was ripped in two when Nyatto tried to save her from Death. She trails after him, brain-dead. They encounter many brilliant, mind-bending situations, beginning with a disturbing magic show.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/masaakiyuasa)\n\nAn acclaimed anime director known for his wild, freeform style. \n\nAfter graduating from the Kyushu Sangyo University's Faculty of Arts in 1987 he joined studio [Ajia-do](https://anilist.co/studio/30/Ajiado), initially as in-betweener but rapidly moving to key animation. \n\nIn the first part of his career Yuasa established himself as an idiosyncratic creator while working on several child friendly anime, such as [Chibi Maruko-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/951/Chibi-Marukochan/) and [Doraemon](https://anilist.co/anime/2677/Doraemon-Nobitas-Animal-Planet/), but especially on [Crayon Shin-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/966/Shin-Chan/), a project he was involved with for most of the '90s. \n\nOne of his breakthrough roles in this period was his participation on the second part of [The Hakkenden](https://anilist.co/anime/12715/The-Hakkenden-Legend-of-the-Dog-Warriors-Part-2/), working as animation director under [Shinya Oohira](https://anilist.co/staff/103893/Shinya-Oohira)'s direction. This OVA was an important outing of the '90s, uniting many veteran artists and talented newcomers. \n\nHe debuted as director on [Mind Game](https://anilist.co/anime/875/Mind-Game/), an abstract piece combining animation and live-action footage, winning the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival (overcoming even Hayao Miyazaki's [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/)), and earning [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/Yoshiyuki-Tomino)'s praise, who acted as the chief judge. After Mind Game Yuasa spent several years at [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE) working on various projects. In 2013, he founded [Science SARU](https://anilist.co/studio/6145/Science-SARU) alongside his close affiliate [Eun-Yeong Choi](https://anilist.co/staff/115088/EunYeong-Choi).\n\nOn March 25, 2020 it was announced Yuasa stepped down as the CEO of Science SARU. He would work there as director until the completion of his latest Movie, [Inu-Oh](https://anilist.co/anime/109928/InuOh/), and would later cease any affiliation with the studio.\n\nOn February 17, 2025 it was announced that Yuasa would launch of his own animation studio, ame pippin. Their debut project would be the film [Daisy's Life](https://anilist.co/anime/190574/Hinagiku-no-Jinsei/).",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/吉成曜) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoh_Yoshinari) | [Sakugabooru](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=yoh_yoshinari)\n\nA Japanese animator, director and storyboard artist currently working at [Trigger](https://anilist.co/studio/803/). Yoshinari entered the anime industry through the influence of his older brother, [Kou Yoshinari](https://anilist.co/staff/102136/). Several of his early works were uncredited second key animation and in-betweens for his brother during high school. After leaving professional school, he applied to [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/) and [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/). Not receiving a response from Gainax, he joined Madhouse. Due to a misunderstanding, Gainax failed to process his application until three months later. Not wanting to explain, Yoshinari told Madhouse; \"being an animator is too hard for me,\" and switched to Gainax.\n\nAt Gainax, Yoshinari had joined just after the closure of [Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water](https://anilist.co/anime/1251/). With nothing to do, he was immediately put onto visual development for the film [Aoki Uru](https://anilist.co/anime/21430/), although the film’s production was later broken off due to the studio’s financial state. Undoubtedly his breakout as an animator was just a few years later when he served as one of the lead animators in [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/). Yoshinari worked at Gainax until leaving for Trigger in 2011, a studio founded by fellow ex-Gainax members, [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/) and [Masahiko Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/). At Trigger he debuted as a director on [Little Witch Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/14349/).\n\nYoshinari is recognized by the way he represents volume and perspective using spheres, especially for smoke and explosions, as well as his character action in general. His characters often borrow traits from western animation, such as rectangular heads, low contrast shading, big eyes and angular lineart. He uses expertly timed smears, dramatic camerawork, and complicated background animation to convey dynamism. His movement is springy and tense, cleanly situated in the dominant cartoony style of ‘00s Gainax. He remarks [Nijitte Monogatari](https://anilist.co/manga/112385/) as one of his most important influences, with his artistic style particularly visible in his design work for [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://anilist.co/anime/2001/) and Little Witch Academia.\n\nAlso a big fan of [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/)’s, having done multiple short [animations](https://anilist.co/anime/123638/) based on his manga characters.\n\nMarried to producer [Naoko Tsutsumi](https://anilist.co/staff/150017/).\n\n(Sources: Wikipedia, Anidb, Animators Wiki)",

          "description": "In 1990, she debuted in the June issue of the monthly manga anthology Garo with Nekojiru Udon, which is now considered her definitive work. She committed suicide on May 10, 1998. As per her own and her families wishes, she is buried in an unmarked grave. Yoshiaki Yoshinaga has written about his friendship with Nekojiru, along with more stories about her, and her eventual suicide, in a memoir dedicated to her titled \"Memories of Nekojiru\".\n\nWith the exception of Tsunami, all Nekojiru's work has main characters drawn as cats. Even in her manga essays, Jirujiru Travel Journal and Jirujiru Diary, she drew herself as a cat. But though the characters appear as animals, the artist chose as her setting not a forest, but rather the human world. Her manga detailing the daily life and adventures of the cats Nyāko and Nyatta are held in high esteem. The major themes of her work are a child-like zaniness, cruelty and nostalgia. And, as we know from Dream Memo, included in the posthumously released compilation Nekojiru Udon 3, many of her bizarre works of fantasy were based on her own dream experiences. Psychedelic mushrooms and LSD also often appear in her works. Her husband Yamano Hajime, using the pen-name Nekojiru-y, took over Nekojiru's world, and continues to produce new works. Currently on his official site, one can read a free chapter of Nekojiru's manga.",
