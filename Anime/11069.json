          "description": "While studying at Tokyo University of the Arts, Kotabe was impressed by the film [The Tale of the White Serpent](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and the animator [Yasuji Mori](https://anilist.co/staff/103602/), and immediately applied to work at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/).\n\nHis first project there was [Magic Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/4948/), the first ever anime to be released theatrically in North America. At the studio he also met [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) and [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), with whom he later left in order to work at A Pro, and they began work on an adaptation of Pippi Longstocking. That project was eventually canceled, and work began on the two-film series [Panda! Go Panda!](https://anilist.co/anime/2611/).\n\nKotabe then worked as character designer on two highly influential series directed by Takahata: [Heidi, Girl of the Alps](https://anilist.co/anime/2225/), and [3000 Leagues in Search of Mother](https://anilist.co/anime/1663/). Miyazaki also took part working on scene design and layouts.\n\nIn 1985, he was scouted by Nintendo and assumed the position of the game development advisor. He worked at Nintendo for over two decades until leaving in 2007.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Ken Sugimori is a Japanese video game designer, illustrator, manga artist, and director. He is most famous as the character designer and art director for the Pokémon franchise. Sugimori is also credited with the art direction for other titles, including Pulseman.  \n\nSugimori drew all of the original 151 Pokémon himself. He has worked on the various Pokémon movies, trading cards, and other games like the Super Smash Bros. series. From early 1981 until 1986, Sugimori illustrated a gaming fanzine called Game Freak, which had been started by Satoshi Tajiri. Sugimori discovered the magazine in a doujinshi shop, and decided to get involved. Eventually, the two decided to pitch an arcade game design idea to Namco; they reworked Game Freak into a development company and produced Mendel Palace. \n\nSugimori is most famous as the character designer and art director for the Pokémon franchise. He has worked on the various Pokémon movies, trading cards, and other games. For Pokémon Black and White, Sugimori directed a team of 17 people in designing new characters for the games, though he always drew the final designs. He drew much of his inspiration from observing animals in aquariums and zoos. \n\nSugimori has also written and illustrated original manga, including one which was distributed with pre-orders of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness. When he begins a new character, his process normally involves making a rough sketch, then tracing it on to film paper while polishing it and making the illustration more professional looking. After that, he draws the character many times, changing its proportions until he is satisfied.",

          "description": "Shinji Miyazaki  is a Japanese composer and arranger. He was born in Kobe, and lived in a variety of areas on the island of Shikoku for much of his childhood. He developed a taste for pop music, which eventually led him to study musical arrangement and piano instruction at the Shobi College of Music. He took some time in deciding that music would become his career, but eventually decided to become an arranger, and later a composer.\n\nHis work has dealt primarily with musical scores for anime. His most well known contributions include music for the Crayon Shin-chan series and music for much of the Pokémon anime series and most of the films in it from 1997 to 2019. His work pulls from many inspirations, among them J-Pop and American pop influences, as well as jazz artist Gil Evans. Many of his compositions utilize string and brass instruments, particularly the french horn.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
