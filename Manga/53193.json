In July of 2011, he revealed on Media Factory's website that he had advanced stage cancer that was discovered in February of that year and which was untreatable at the time. \n\nAfter an unrelated gallstone surgery, the cancerous growth was found to have shrunk allowing surgery to take place in early August 2011. On November 1, 2011, he was invited to the event of \"Amazon.co.jp 10th Anniversary\", and he was inducted to a hall of fame in Japanese Books section, Amazon.co.jp 10th Anniversary. He was later readmitted to the hospital in December 2011, and had another surgery in November 2012. Yamaguchi died at the age of 41. His funeral was held on April 9. His death was publicly announced on April 11 by his family and publishers.\n\n",

He is notable for the illustration for the series Zero no Tsukaima. He illustrates insert images for many novels.   \n\nAfter university graduation he was employed as illustrator by the visual novel publisher Visual Art's using the pseudonym Sawagani (サワガニ, Japanese Freshwater Crab). As side job he made illustrations for light novels which is against the company policy. The similarity of \"both peoples\" designs, were however noticed and later revealed by Tōya Okano (scenario assistant for Visual Art's' Clannad) in a Dengeki G's Magazine interview article presenting Visual Art's brand Mana's game Angel Magister.  \n\n (Source: Wikipedia)",
