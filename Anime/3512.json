  "description": "In a rainy spring day, first year high schooler Midori Saezima saw a tall, handsome fellow student took care of a stray kitten. Without knowing the boy's name, she fell in love with him at the first sight. Due to sickness, Midori returned to school three days after summer vacation -- only to find out that she was \"volunteered\" as a candidate for student council. After a series of embarrassing accidents, both she and the mysterious boy she had a crush on, Akira Sudo, were elected as members of the student council. Being the first student council of this newly established high school, they are about to create \"new traditions\" for their school and a bittersweet love story for themselves...\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

In 1985, Yazawa made her manga debut in the pages of the monthly girl's anthology RIBON with the title 15th Year. While her tales focused on young love, but what captivated readers was her stunning sense of design. Since then she has gone to pen eleven more titles and has sold more than 100,000,000 books in Japan alone. Her title NANA, an international sensation that spun off multiple movies and an animated TV series, was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award in 2002, and even inspired talents such as Gwen Stefani. Paradise Kiss has been translated into 10 languages and is considered her defining work. The last name of her pen name is taken from singer-songwriter Eikichi Yazawa, whom she respects.\n\nIn June 2009, it was revealed that Yazawa had contracted a sudden illness, and had to be sent to hospital for treatment, putting Nana on hiatus. She returned from the hospital in April 2010, although has yet to reveal when or if she will be continuing Nana. Yazawa has worked on a variety of small illustrative projects since putting Nana on hold. She provided artwork for singer JUJU's single Iiwake in 2017 and a celebratory illustration for Space Channel 5 VR in 2020, drew a mini-manga featuring characters from her series Tenshi Nanka Ja Nai and Neighborhood Story in 2016, contributed new images to the 2015 Nana calendar, and published a new \"Junko's Room\" chapter, her first new manga in over three years, in 2013.",

          "description": "She got her start in the industry working as a part-time cel painter in the late ‘70s while studying at Nihon University. During this time she met [Yuuji Nunokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/117781/), who then invited her to join the establishment of [Studio Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/) in 1978.\n\nAt Pierrot she worked as an in-betweener on [Nils no Fushigi no Tabi](https://anilist.co/anime/2151/), the studio’s first show. After this she went freelance and soon gave up on her talent as an animator and turned into directing. She asked for guidance from [Kouichi Mashimo](https://anilist.co/staff/100094/), and made her debut as one of the two episode directors on the 29th episode of [Gold Lightan](https://anilist.co/anime/7106/) in 1981.\n\nShe continued her work storyboarding and directing episodes on shows such as [Dash Kappei](https://anilist.co/anime/2748/), [Miyuki](https://anilist.co/anime/2231/) and [Glass no Kamen](https://anilist.co/anime/506/). After this she made her series director debut with [Touch](https://anilist.co/anime/1065/) in 1985, a role which she was hand-picked for by [Gisaburou Sugii](https://anilist.co/staff/103537/), who served as the show’s chief director. They both reprised their roles for [Hiatari Ryoukou!](https://anilist.co/anime/729/) which took over the TV slot for Touch. After this Tokita directed [Yawara!](https://anilist.co/anime/691/), instead this time without an overseeing director.\n\nAfter having directed several more titles in the ‘90s, she switched her focus entirely to scriptwriting. As a writer she most famously worked on shows like [Tsukihime](https://anilist.co/anime/169/) and [School Rumble](https://anilist.co/anime/24/) before leaving the industry in 2009.",
