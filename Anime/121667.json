Previously an illustrator and doll maker, he has collaborated with Tadasu Iizawa and trained under Tadahito Mochinaga and, later, Jiří Trnka. His most famous creations in his native Japan are the puppets he designed and made for a long-running TV series adaptation of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms; internationally he is better known for his own short films. Most of these are model animation; Tabi and Shijin no Shōgai are cutout animation and the French-language Farce anthropo-cynique is mixed media.",

He also made a number of films in traditional animation, using then-expensive, imported cels, while his earliest work known to have survived is a live-action/animated film. He trained under Junichi Kouchi before starting his own company. \n\nHe is known for his employment of washi, especially the coloured and patterned Edo chiyogami, which gives his films a distinctively Japanese appearance. He was one of the first Japanese animators to earn international recognition for his work.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
