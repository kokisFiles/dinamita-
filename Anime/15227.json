  "description": "The story follows a young lady named Suzu Urano, who in 1944 moves to the small town of Kure in Hiroshima to live with her husband's family. Suzu's life is thrown into chaos when her town is bombed during World War II. Her perseverance and courage underpin this heart-warming and inspirational tale of the everyday challenges faced by the Japanese in the midst of a violent, war-torn country. This beautiful yet poignant tale shows that even in the face of adversity and loss, people can come together and rebuild their lives.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Shout! Factory)",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She started playing piano when she was 5 years old. After graduating from KOYO SCHOOL OF MUSIC（current・KOYO SCHOOL OF MUSIC&DANCE), she went to study abroad in Boston, then graduated from Berklee College of Music with a Bachelor of Music in Jazz composition and a Bachelor of Music in Performance. In 2006, \"Nichiyomachi (Waiting for Sunday)\" which would become her 2nd single, was on air at the J-WAVE radio audition program \"RADIO SAKAMOTO\" navigated by Ryuichi Sakamoto, then she performed in \"LOHAS CLASSIC Concert\" also produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto.

Since then, she has released 11 solo albums and 7 soundtrack albums. The latest solo album is “Ame no hakoniwa (My garden in the rain)” released in 2017. She composed the whole score in a long-running hit animated movie “Konosekai no Katasumi ni (In This Corner of the World)” released in November 2016, which led to her winning the 40th Japan Academy Film Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Music, the 71st Mainichi Film Awards for Best Music, and Best Music Award in the Osaka Cinema Festival 2017. Music of “In This Corner of the World” Concert, which represented the movie in a music concert, was well-received all over the country. At present, she has earned a high reputation as a singer-songwriter, composer and pianist with works on soundtracks for movies, dramas, animations, and commercials, and has a deeper expression of orchestra arrangements as well as performances. In recent years, the range of her voice expressions has expanded, including narration. In 2018, she visited Argentina on her first overseas tour, making all six performances a huge success and gained worldwide acclaim.
