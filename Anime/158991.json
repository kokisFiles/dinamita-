There are various ways to describe him as a musician, some call him a \"hand magician\", or a \"one-person amusement park\", some even say it's like watching a magic trick. Not only does he perform live at the country's floorboard, he also performs on the internet on sites such as YouTube and Nico Nico Douga, where he attracts lots of attention from all generations alike, but he's a lot more popular with the younger generation.",

          "description": "Ichirou Itano is a Japanese director, producer, animator and mechanical designer. He has worked in a number of science fiction anime series, especially mecha-themed ones. Director of works such as [Angel Cop](https://anilist.co/anime/1351/), [Battle Royal High School](https://anilist.co/anime/3625/), [Gantz](https://anilist.co/anime/384/) and more.\n\nItano is best known among anime fans for a style of action scene that he developed, usually nicknamed \"Itano Circus\" by fans; it refers to a highly stylized and acrobatic method of depicting aerial combat and dogfights in many anime.\n\nThe production in [Space Runaway Ideon](https://anilist.co/anime/930/) became a hot topic in the anime industry, and it came to be called this by comparing the brisk movement of mechanics to the air acrobatics of the circus. The technique became more famous when Itano used it for the \"dogfights\" depicted in [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) anime TV series in 1982. It's characterized by detailed, fluid shading of the mecha, the close-range acrobatic moves the dueling fighters make in combat, as well as twisting contrails left by fighters and missiles. It is also commonly used in specific reference to an attack where a mecha or spaceship launches a large swarm of guided missiles with meticulously animated spiraling smoke trails and erratic trajectories and its target is repeatedly dodging those missiles at a high speed.\n\nAccording to him, [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), [Masami Gotou](https://anilist.co/staff/129865/) and [Yasushi Muraki](https://anilist.co/staff/105090/) are the only animators to have fully mastered Itano Circus.",

          "description": "Akira Amemiya is an animator and up-and-coming director best known for directing [SSSS.GRIDMAN](https://anilist.co/anime/99424/SSSSGRIDMAN) and being Studio Trigger founder [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/Hiroyuki-Imaishi)'s protege. Amemiya's [animation and directing](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mini-imaishi.mp4) is very similar to Imaishi's yet is less chaotic and contains more 'retro' devices like impact frames and multi-tonal shading, drawing a lot of inspiration from [Masami Obari](https://anilist.co/staff/100660/Masami-Obari). For these reasons he was frequently typecasted for old school pose-heavy mecha combat.\n\nAmemiya is a nerdy director whose anime often heavily references other series and artists he loves, sometimes even replicating Obari's [animation sequences](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dangaioh2.mp4) and [layouts](https://i.imgur.com/nTRdM4K.jpg), [Transformer](https://twitter.com/SSS_SGRID/status/1051063114022572033)'s color designs, and Hideaki Anno's [establishing shots](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/welcome-to-the-anno-class.jpg) as well as long-lingering framing. Amemiya called Anno's [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/) his [favorite series before](https://i.imgur.com/nEYK186.png). Between his ode-heavy artistry he interjects personality with [subtle details](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/what-kind-of-brand-is-TOMATO-LIFE-tho.jpg), visual gags, and repurposing tonally contrasting homages into a different context.\n\nAmemiya graduated from Tokyo University of Technology and was part of the university's anime research society. During his time there he became heavily influenced by Osaka University's anime research club [Group CAS](https://twitter.com/group_cas). At the time [Toshiyuki Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/107357/Toshiyuki-Satou) was part of the group, while [Ikehata Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/120505/Ikehata-Hiroshi) visited regularly. After a bit of indie work Amemiya joined studio Gainax and climbed up the hierarchy: from clean-up to animation direction, onto storyboarding and episode directing, until after joining studio Trigger and co-directing Kill la Kill finally having the credentials to debut with his own series.\n\nHe is married to animator [Megumi Kouno](https://anilist.co/staff/120602/Megumi-Kouno).\n\n",
