  "description": "There once existed a planet named Beal, until it was wiped out by the mysterious entity known as Gaizok. The few remaining survivors escaped to Earth and split into three families, named Jin, Kamie, and Kamikita respectively. While attempting to start a new life, the collectively known \"Jin Family\" prepared for the inevitable Gaizok invasion on Earth and its giant mechanical beasts known as \"Mecha Boosts\". In order to defend their new home, they have built three vehicles which when combined form the mighty Zambot 3. The Jin Family must not only defend against Gaizok attacks, but also harsh criticisms from the very people they protect, who blame the Jin Family for the invasion in the first place.<br><br>\r\n(Source: AniDB)",

In the 70s he became a freelancer and worked on TV anime. Some of his most famous work as a character designer or director are \"Space Battleship Yamato\", \"Brave Raideen\", \"Combattler V\" and \"Mobile Suit Gundam\".\n\nIn 1979, he made his debut as a mangaka with \"Arion\" serialized in the newly founded magazine \"Ryu\". Following this, Yasuhiko alternated between the Anime and Manga worlds with works like \"Kiba - The Legend of White Fang\", \"Crusher Joe\", and \"Giant Gorg\", and \"Star of the Kurds\", \"C-Court\", and \"Venus Wars\".\n\nThese worlds would overlap, when his manga \"Arion\" would get adapted into an anime film in 1986 with the title \"Neo Heroic Fantasia: Arion\". Following this, he would adapt his SF Military Chronicle \"Venus Wars\" into an anime film in 1989. The anime film adaptation for \"Venus Wars\" came at an unfortunate point for Yasuhiko, and the film was sealed, preventing it from being made readily available on home video formats in Japan (though still made accessible overseas). He turned to manga completely and had gained a respectable reputation as a history mangaka with works focusing on both Japanese history with \"Jinmu\", \"Namuji\", \"Yamato Takeru\" and European history with \"Alexandros\", \"Joan\", and Theology with \"Jesus\".\n\nIn 2001 he adapted the First Gundam anime into a manga with \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\" and was colossally popular, being serialized for 24 Tankoban volumes.\n\nWith over 50 years worth of experience across multiple mediums of entertainment and showing no signs of stopping, Yasuhiko's terrific worldview continues to touch the hearts of many around the world.\n\nIn 1981, he won the Seiun Award in the Art category. In 1992, he received the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for his work \"Namuji\". From 1979 to 1982, he ranked first in the Anime Grand Prix for Character Design. In 2000, he won the Japan Media Arts Festival Excellence Prize in the Manga category for \"Ōdō no Inu\". In 2012, he won the Seiun Award in the Best Comic category for \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\". In 2015, he received the Animation Kobe Special Award.",

This precept is still respected today and it's one of the reasons Japanese animation is so distinctly unique. His career is also a testament to his ethos that expressive and vibrant animation is not achieved simply through increasing the number of frames but through playing with movement, poses and timing.\n\nIn the early '00s, Kanada became an employee at Square Enix.\n\nNotable Square Enix titles in which he was credited:\n\n~!\n- 2002, Final Fantasy XI (Motion Capture, Animation Director)\n- 2005, Musashiden II: Blade Master (Storyboard)\n- 2006, Dawn of Mana (Facial Setting)\n- 2007, Final Fantasy 4 DS Version (Storyboard)\n- 2009, Final Fantasy XIII (Storyboard Director) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2011, Final Fantasy XIII-2 (Storyboard) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2012, Dragon Quest X (Storyboard)  - *Posthumous credit.* !~",

He was planning to go to art college, but was invited to join Mushi Pro, so he quit high school and joined the company. He participated as an animator for the first [Astro Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/) series. In 1967, he participated in the founding of _Art Fresh with Gisaburou Sugii and Osamu Dezaki_. After working as an animator on Mushi Production's [Gokuu no Daibouken](https://anilist.co/anime/2687/), which Art Fresh participated in, he worked as a freelance animator before becoming a senior director and board member of Dyna-Method Inc.\n\nIn addition to serving as episode director, storyboard artist and writer, he also worked as a director. He has participated in [Tensai Bakabon](https://anilist.co/anime/6468/), [Star of the Giants](https://anilist.co/anime/5834/), [Ashita no Joe](https://anilist.co/anime/2402/), [Moomin](https://anilist.co/anime/8234/), [Lupin III](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/), [Invincible Super Man Zambot 3](https://anilist.co/anime/2200/), [Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3](https://anilist.co/anime/3305/), and [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/).\n\nIn addition to anime, he created, wrote and directed Star Guardian with Airship Theater Company, wrote the screenplays for Tanoshii Moomin Ikka and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and wrote and directed The Wizard of Oz. It all started when he was asked by director [Masaaki Oosumi](https://anilist.co/staff/122102/) to help with the screenplay of Aladdin for Airship Theater Company's Aladdin when he was working on the TV adaptation of Moomin. In addition, he has worked on commercials, events, performances and novels. He has been a fan of science fiction since he read Shounen Shoujo Sekai Kagaku Bouken Zenshuu by Kodansha when he was a kid.\n\nOne of the reasons that the 100th episode of the [Kirby: Right Back at Ya!](https://anilist.co/anime/2390/) anime contained some problems, inconsistencies, and heavy-handedness in the plot and development is that Yoshikawa, who wrote the final episode, learned that his wife was in critical condition at the time and had to rush through the script and leave it in incomplete form in order to be present for her dying moments.\n\n[Yasuo Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/) cited in an interview for the Lupin III Perfect Book: Complete Collector's Edition, that [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), Osamu Dezaki, and Yoshikawa as representative members of the Japanese anime world.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n",
