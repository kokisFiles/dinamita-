After having graduated high school in 1973, he left Miyagi, heading to Tokyo with the hopes of becoming a mangaka. He made his debut later on the same year with a manga adaptation of Prosper Mérimée's short novel Mateo Falcone, titled A Gun Report. In 1979, after writing multiple short-stories for the magazine Action, Ootomo created his first science-fiction work, titled Fireball. Although the manga was never completed, it is regarded as a milestone in Ootomo's career, containing many of the same themes he would later explore in [Doumu](https://anilist.co/manga/31215/), which began serialization in January 1980 and ran for two years until completed.\n\nIn 1982, Ootomo made his anime debut as character designer on [Harmagedon](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/). After this Ootomo began working on Akira, which would become his most acclaimed and famous work. The manga took eight years to complete and would eventually culminate in 2000 pages of artwork.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Takumi Nagayasu discovered the work of Chiba Tetsuya at a very young age. Impressed by its dynamics, he left for Tokyo to start a career in comics. In 1964 he became the assistant of Namba Kenji. While being his Namba's assistant, he drew his first own comic, 'Ofukuro' in 1968. Nagayasu remained in the shadows of his master for many years, until he met Otomo Katsuhiro, who wrote a scenario for him. Together they made 'Mother Sarah', the series about a mother searching for her children in a postnuclear world, which was published in several other countries. He is also the co-author, with Asada Jiro, of 'Poppoya', a serial about a lonely stationmaster.",
