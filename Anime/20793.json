Her father had spent 9 years abroad and was fluent in English, which allowed her to develop fluency in the language. From an early age she had an interest in anime, in particular the series _Ojamajo Doremi_ and _Sailor Moon_. However, it was the anime series _Fullmetal Alchemist_ that was the first to inspire her to become a voice actress. At the time, she was impressed that the series' protagonist Edward Elric was voiced by a female actress, [Romi Park](https://anilist.co/staff/95082/Romi-Park).\n\nIn junior high school and high school, she became part of a chorus club to help her overcome her tone deafness. It was also during this time she decided to pursue a voice acting career as she had interacted with schoolmates who had similar interests. Her parents approved of her decision, provided that she pass her university entrance exams. \n\n__Voice Acting Career__\nWhile in high school, she began attending the Japan Narration Acting Institute. After 3 years of training, she passed her audition and joined the agency Arts Vision. At the same time, she also passed her entrance exam and began studying at Waseda University. She debuted as a voice actress in 2010 and later that year she played her first main role in the anime series _The World God Only Knows_. Throughout her 4 years in University, she continued to work as a voice actress, successfully managing both her work and school responsibilities. She graduated in March 2014 and left Art Vision shortly after on April 1. On May 1, 2014, she transferred to the agency Intention and is currently affiliated with them today.\n\n__Music Career__\nHer music career began when she released songs for _The World God Only Knows_ under her character name Kanon Nakagawa. In 2013, she became part of the music group Rhodanthe*, which performed theme songs for the _Kiniro Mosaic_ series. After having been cast in 2015, she has also released singles as her Idolmaster character Mizuki Kawashima. In 2016, she voiced a member of the in-universe music group Walküre, which performed songs for the anime series _Macross Δ_.\n\nIn 2017, she made her solo debut as a singer on February 1 with the release of her single \"True Destiny\" / \"Chain the World\" under the Flying Dog label. Later that year, her second single \"Ima Koko\" / \"Tsuki ga Kirei\" was released on May 24 as well as her first album _Rainbow_ on October 25. In 2018, she held her first solo live event at the Nippon Budokan on February 3 and released her third single \"Tomoshibi no Manima ni\" on May 30. In 2019, she released her second album _Gunjou Infinity_ on April 3. During the months of August and September, she held her first tour live event performing in the cities of Osaka, Nagoya, and Yokohama as well as cities outside of Japan like Taipei and Shanghai. In 2020, her fourth single \"Aruite Ikou!\" is set to release on February 5.\n\n__Non-Anime Roles:__\n- Misono Mika in \"Blue Archive\" (VG)\n- Mualani in \"Genshin Impact\" (VG)\n- Juna Crawford - The Legend of Heroes Series (VG)",

She has been active as a voice actor since 2010, debuting in the anime Occult Academy voicing the character Akari Okamoto, while debuting as a singer-songwriter in December 2015.\n\nInori was born in Tokyo, where she began watching anime in kindergarten. She first became aware of voice acting when, after watching a stage play adaption of an anime, she read the stage pamphlet and asked her parents about a person mentioned in it. She found out that she wanted to become a voice actor at the age of six, and at elementary school she listed voice acting as her desired future career. \n\nIn middle school, Inori joined her school's tennis and theater clubs, however, she quit the theater club due to feeling too embarrassed when appearing on stage. Around the same time, her mother found a magazine advertising for a voice-acting audition, which she participated in and won.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)\n\n**Non-anime roles:**\n- Iris - Memento Mori (VG)\n- Soline - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Furina - Genshin Impact (VG)\n- Balloon Party - Reverse: 1999 (VG)",
