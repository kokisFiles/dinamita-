His parents cover every inch of his body with garments, including a mask on his face. One day, Inu-Oh meets a blind boy named Tomona, a biwa player. As Tomona starts to sing and play, Inu-Oh is amazed to discover he has an incredible ability to dance. The two become inseparable. Tomona and Inu-Oh start sharing their talent with audiences. Their performances quickly gain acclaim and draw crowds. But why is Tomona blind? Why was Inu-Oh born looking like he does? A story about a legendary artist from 14th-century Japan, who defied fate to forge his own destiny. An anime in the form of a rock operetta with spectacular music and dance sequences.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Warsaw Film Festival)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: The film received an early premiere at the 78th Venice International Film Festival on September 9, 2021.</i>",

This OVA was an important outing of the '90s, uniting many veteran artists and talented newcomers. \n\nHe debuted as director on [Mind Game](https://anilist.co/anime/875/Mind-Game/), an abstract piece combining animation and live-action footage, winning the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival (overcoming even Hayao Miyazaki's [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/)), and earning [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/Yoshiyuki-Tomino)'s praise, who acted as the chief judge. After Mind Game Yuasa spent several years at [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE) working on various projects. In 2013, he founded [Science SARU](https://anilist.co/studio/6145/Science-SARU) alongside his close affiliate [Eun-Yeong Choi](https://anilist.co/staff/115088/EunYeong-Choi).\n\nOn March 25, 2020 it was announced Yuasa stepped down as the CEO of Science SARU. He would work there as director until the completion of his latest Movie, [Inu-Oh](https://anilist.co/anime/109928/InuOh/), and would later cease any affiliation with the studio.\n\nOn February 17, 2025 it was announced that Yuasa would launch of his own animation studio, ame pippin. Their debut project would be the film [Daisy's Life](https://anilist.co/anime/190574/Hinagiku-no-Jinsei/).",

          "description": "Originally he wanted to become a famous soccer player, but eventually chose an artistic profession instead. He made his debut in Afternoon, Kodansha's monthly seinen manga magazine, but is probably best known for his works with Kodansha's rival publisher Shogakukan. He has received critical praise for his unconventional and often surrealist art style. Ping Pong and Blue Spring have both been adapted into live-action feature films. Furthermore, acclaimed animation studio Studio 4°C adapted Tekkonkinkreet into an animated feature film in 2006, and in 2014 Tatsunoko Production produced an anime adaptation of Ping Pong, which was directed by Masaaki Yuasa.\n\nIn 2007 he received an Excellence Award for manga at the Japan Media Arts Festival for the art of Takemitsu Zamurai.\n\nTaiyo is the cousin of [Santa Inoue](https://anilist.co/staff/97830), another critically acclaimed mangaka.\nHis wife [Saho Touno](https://anilist.co/staff/174013) is also a mangaka and assists Taiyou with erasing, coloring, and occasional editorial guidance.",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/松本憲生)\n\nOriginating from Tatsunoko's animators training institute, where he met [Atsushi Wakabayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/105805/). Though primarily an action animator, he’s demonstrated impressive range elsewhere like in his scenes for [Haibane Renmei](https://anilist.co/anime/387/) and [Kaguya-hime](https://anilist.co/anime/16664/). He has the reputation of a fast and disciplined worker. [Toshiyuki Inoue](https://anilist.co/staff/103724/) said that he must have a “secret” for producing such a large volume of superb cuts.\n\nThough one of his earliest assignments was as an in-betweens checker for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/), his first major job was on [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), working under the director of the series, [Kazuhiro Furuhashi](https://anilist.co/staff/100655/). He would collaborate with Furuhashi again on Rurouni Kenshin, [You’re Under Arrest](https://anilist.co/anime/1577/), and [Hunter x Hunter](https://anilist.co/anime/136/). Around this time Matsumoto was also mentored by [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on [Irresponsible Captain Tylor](https://anilist.co/anime/569/).\n\nMatsumoto’s character animation is loose and full of smears, often looking like featureless masses in individual frames. He draws smoke without highlights, a tendency that earned the nickname “Norio smoke” and has been imitated by animators like [Shingo Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/114914/) and [Kenichi Kutsuna](https://anilist.co/staff/116007/). He occasionally storyboards his own scenes as he did for the 12th episode of [Birdy Decode:02](https://anilist.co/anime/5074/), the [third Naruto movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2144/), and episodes 31 & 85 of [Rurouni Kenshin](https://anilist.co/anime/45/). Prefers battles that take place in wide-open spaces with lots of forward momentum and background movement. Influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) and [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/), and has adapted elements of their approach for a wider audience.\n\nWhenever he serves as animation director on an episode, he does a lot of the key animation work himself. He also soloed the 7th episode of [Eat-Man](https://anilist.co/anime/1704/) and the [Kuragehime](https://anilist.co/anime/8129/) ED. He failed attempting to solo the 39th episode of You’re Under Arrest, and requested his name not be on the telop despite animating the vast majority of the episode.\n\nFamous for his work on the [Naruto](https://anilist.co/anime/20/) franchise, in which he often collaborated with Atsushi Wakabayashi.\n\nAs a well known animator with a wide network of connections, he regularly helps and receives help from his friends.\n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",
