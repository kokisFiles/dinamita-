  "description": "The people of Iorph live far away from the lands of men, weaving the happenings of each day into a fabric called Hibiol. They live for centuries while maintaining their youthful appearance. Maquia, an orphaned Iorph girl, lives her life in an oasis surrounded by friends, yet somehow feels “alone”. But the tranquil lives of the Iorph are shattered in an instant when the Mezarte army invades their territory on a dragon fleet, seeking the blood that grants the Iorph long life. Maquia manages to escape, but loses her friends and her home in the chaos. She then encounters an orphaned baby who is “alone”. Maquia raises this boy \"Ariel\", with the help of some new friends. But as the era changes, the bond between Maquia and Ariel changes too, amidst a backdrop of racial tensions between the Iorph and the Mezarte. This is a story of irreplaceable time, woven by two lonely people who can only find solace in each other.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Eleven Arts)",

However, he dropped out after half a year. With a few friends, he created the band Muse, playing fusion rock and participating in music competitions. Through competing in such contests, the band members became technically competent to enter the music industry and decided to part ways.\n\nAfter leaving Muse, Kawai Kenji began composing music for commercials in his home studio. While recording music for [Yuji Mitsuya](https://anilist.co/staff/95874/) he met music director Naoko Asari, who advised him to compose anime soundtracks. Some of his most famous anime soundtracks can be found in [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/1288/), [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), [Fate/Stay Night](https://anilist.co/anime/356/), [When They Cry](https://anilist.co/anime/934/) and more recently in [Mob Psycho 100](https://anilist.co/anime/21507/).\n\nHe has worked on several projects with the director [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) and has written scores for all of Hideo Nakata's films. Kenji Kawai's music has received the Annie award and Hong Kong Film Award in 2005, for [Ghost in The Shell 2: Innocence](https://anilist.co/anime/468/) he was nominated for an Annie award.\n\nFollowing his success as an anime music composer, he became involved in live action movies. He contributed music to horror films: Ring, Ring 2, Dark Water, Japanese-Polish science-fiction film Avalon and the Hong Kong film Seven Swords.\n\nFor the music found in Seven Swords and A Battle of Wits he was nominated for Best Original Film Score Awards at both the 25th and 26th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2006 and 2007.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

In the game industry he is well-known for his work on the _Final Fantasy_ series and for his frequent collaboration with game designer Yasumi Matsuno, while in the anime industry he has had some involvement in doing character designs for certain shows.\n\nHe started working for Square Co. in 1995, before the company eventually merged with Enix and became Square Enix. He then left company Square Enix in September of 2013, and became a freelance creator. On October of 2014, he became the company director of CyDesignation, which is a subsidiary of Cygames.\n\n__Biography:__\nIn 1995, Akihiko joined then named Square Co, and with each project he took on, he experimented with different styles of graphic design. He has compared his use of color to that of character designer Tetsuya Nomura, who has worked on the game series Kingdom Hearts. In addition he is alike in the way that they similarily try to keep the color consistent between the characters and game world.\n\nFor the game Tactics Ogre, the pencil etchings and CG coloration were used together for the first time. Akihiko considers the tone and style of the game to be the \"ideal\" art style and is thus within his comfort zone. The original tarot card illustrattions for the game were done with dot graphics, and reflected a limited color index. When remade for the PlayStation Portable (PSP), some staff wanted to use the original illustrations, but Akihiko requested to redraw the illustrattions in more detail and color than was possible or required previously.\n\nWhen designing the character of Vaan for Final Fantasy XII, initially the character had the characteristics of a \"rugged\" and \"tough\" persona, but after considering the demographics of the games audience, the character was made younger and thinner. Once the actors motion captured and voice actor Kohei Takeda did his part, the character became slightly less effeminate than was originally designed. Akihiko set out to create a cast of characters who looked unlike any previous Final Fantasy cast. he also stated that the character reflected what Japanese audiences wanted, but that they did try to design characters everyone likes.\n\n(Source: [Wikipedia (Akihiko Yoshida)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihiko_Yoshida), edited)",
