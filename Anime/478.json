  "description": "When the Shadow Angels invade after 12,000 years of slumber, humanity is held captive by fear and sheer alien dominance. Eleven years after the Great Catastrophe decimated the world, most of those left alive are scavengers, dirty and starving in the streets. There is hope, however: Mechanical Angel Aquarion!<br>\n<br>\nPowered by three souls intertwined, a rare breed of pilot takes the controls. Known as Elements, one among them must rise if mankind is to survive. Prophecy is being fulfilled as the end of the world approaches... Through a swirling cloud of love, betrayal, loss and destiny, the last hope for the new century arrives and takes flight!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Funimation)",

He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",
