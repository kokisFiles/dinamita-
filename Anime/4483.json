  "description": "Get ready for a second magical journey to the world of Someday's Dreamers, where spellcasting is a profession that requires both the proper training AND a license. It's to get that license and fulfill a promise made to her late father that young Sora Suzuki has made the long journey from her distant home in the countryside town of Biei to the big city of Tokyo. It's a daunting challenge, but she's got a little bit of talent, a charming personality and, most important of all, the promise of an internship! What she ISN'T expecting, though, is how different life in the city will be, especially the people themselves. While she gets along with the confident Asagi, Kuroda and the gentle Hiyori, she's completely confused with the mysterious boy Gouta. And yet, as a result of their internships they keep ending up in the same situations and slowly learning to understand more about each other than they ever imagined possible! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

Originally, it was a solo project by the female singer Thyme, who had previously released three singles in 2002 as Sayaka Kamiyama. Kamiyama started collaborating with sound engineer Teppei Shimizu in July 2004, and changed her name to Thyme in June 2005. In December 2005, Thyme (the singer) and Shimizu formed the duo \"Thyme\" (the singer's name is normally stylized as \"thyme\" for distinction). In July 2006, Takafumi Hoshino officially joined and Thyme became a three-piece band. \n\nThey had their major debut in September 2007 with their first official single \"Hello\". Thyme released their second single \"Forever We Can Make It!\" in April 2008; the title song was used as the opening theme to the anime series [To Love-Ru](https://anilist.co/anime/3455/). Thyme released their third single \"Fly Away\" on August 6, 2008, which had the title song used as the opening to the anime [Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto: Natsu no Sora](https://anilist.co/anime/4483/). Thyme released their first (and only) album First 9uality on September 3, 2008. On September 23, 2010, the band officially announced they have broken up, and Thyme (the singer) restarted her solo singing career.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

His animation favors expression above all else, to the point characters often bend out of shape when exposed to extreme forces and speeds. \n\nDespite this he still has a keen eye for delicate and realistic character animation, inspired by the likes of [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/Norio-Matsumoto), as demonstrated on both EDs for Birdy the Mighty Decode and [Shinsekai yori](https://anilist.co/anime/13125/From-the-New-World/) where he handled all aspects of the animation production. \n\nHe is also adept in post production work, often handling the photography, coloring and even CG in his own works.",
