When Charo gives the girl a wreath of Gerbera plants, she accidentally sneezes. A burst of magic came out of the Gerbera, and a flower train emerges from the middle of a flower garden. As the three board the flower train, it starts moving toward the girl's hometown. However, what awaits them is a ferocious storm!\n<br><br>\nAnimated short to support the reconstruction of areas hit by the 2011 Great Eastern Japan Earthquake.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Official website)",

          "description": "Kanno's earliest experiences with music came from attending church with her parents. She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/136171134)\n\nA long-serving anime producer, as well as a founder of [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/) and [Studio M2](https://anilist.co/studio/6137/). He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Kanno's earliest experiences with music came from attending church with her parents. She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",
