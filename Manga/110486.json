  "description": "Omega Syndrome... that is the unfamiliar disease Haru Nishimiya is told he has in the results of his yearly health exam. At the same moment he is surprised by meeting his former high school classmate, and now the doctor in charge of his case, Katsuragi. Haru is told that he has the possibility of becoming pregnant even as a man!? And that he will go into heat and give off pheromones to attract other men!? Haru's body begins to change even as he remains in a state of confusion at his impossible to comprehend disease. \n<br><br>\nThis story is set in the Omegaverse and chronicles the story of the two men who are being toyed with by their past and their current fate. \"I wouldn't have sex with you even if I were dead.\" \"I've always hated you.\" But why does Katsuragi continue to have this one-sided hatred for Haru...?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Renta, edited)\n<br><br>\n<i>Note: Contains four extra chapters.</i>",
