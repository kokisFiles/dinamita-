  "description": "Stories have been told of a legendary craftsman during the Edo-era, by the name of Jingoro Hidari. Today, sculptures accredited to Jingoro can be found throughout Japan, but his very existence is yet to be confirmed. Having lost his foster parent and right arm to the betrayal of his senior apprentices, Jingoro is on a journey of revenge with a mechanical prosthetic arm and his sidekick, “Sleeping Cat.” People soon came to call him Jingoro “Hidari” because of his ability to artfully use his carpentry tools with only his left arm (“hidari” means “left” in Japanese). Finally, Jingoro faces one of his adversaries “Inumaru” and the curtains rise on a fight to the death.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Niigata International Animation Film Festival)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: Public release on 8th March 2023.</i>",
