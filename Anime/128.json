          "description": "__[Website](http://goto.cute.or.jp)__\n\nGotou began his career as an animator at Atorie. After the closing of Atorie, he worked for other studios such as Project Team Muu and Fenx before going freelancer. He serves as character designer, animation director and animator on countless anime series and contributes to a monthly comic strip to Newtype magazine.\n\nHe has been an animator since he graduated from high school at 18. Unlike most other animators Gotou had never gone to an art school. He became interested in animation after seeing an advertisement in an animation magazine saying that animators were needed. Without having any connections within the industry he went on and joined Atelier Giga and studied there for a year under [Akihiko Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/103299/) before marking his debut as animator on [Mister Ajikko](https://anilist.co/anime/3437/).\n\nIn 1988 Studio Atelier declared bancrupcy and he went to Project Team Muu, which later became Phoenix Entertainment. His first work there was as animator on Anime Sanjushi. When working on the Yuusha Saga, he met Ishida Atsuko on Densetsu no Yuusha Da Garn, who influenced Gotou in his character design, particularly the design of the eyes. Together with the experience from training under Yamashita Akihiko this influence resulted in Gotou's so called \"gocky picture\" later.\n\nHe made his debut as character designer on Choujin Densetsu Urotsukidouji 4 and his debut as series director on Kiddy Grade.\n\nMarried to [Megumi Kadonosono](https://anilist.co/staff/100963/).\n\n(Source: Anidb)",

He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work. Another of his most important work is often said to be [Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar](https://anilist.co/anime/890/), and the [sequel](https://anilist.co/anime/1382/) following it.\n\nIn 2002, he won the first Tokyo Anime Award for Best Music for his work on [Overman King Gainer](https://anilist.co/anime/1792/).",
