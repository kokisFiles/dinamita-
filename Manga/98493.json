  "description": "Chroma are bounty hunters for hire that deal with all manner of requests, including monster subjugation. A thirteen-year-old girl named Marona lives on Phantom Isle after losing both of her parents at a young age. Her parents had lost their lives during their jobs as Chroma and now she must become a Chroma to earn money. However, work as a Chroma is difficult and many hold her in disdain as the 'Cursed Girl' because of her ability to talk to and manipulate phantoms. \n<br><br>\nThankfully, she's not alone since she has the help of the phantom named Ash, a friend of her parents that had died alongside them in a mission. Marona's parents' dying wish for Ash was to have him protect their daughter. Now Ash does everything he can to help defend Marona from the hardships of the world.",
