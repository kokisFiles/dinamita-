This mysterious ship carries liquid protons: a power source essential to the survival of Earth&rsquo;s population. But before the precious cargo can be delivered, the base is ambushed by galactic terrorists who seek to destroy the new form of energy and issue a death sentence to all of humanity.<br><br><br>\nSymbiotic Planet:<br>\nAgainst a backdrop of intergalactic colonization and bizarre alien life forms, Aon and Elena &ndash; star-crossed lovers from rival countries competing for valuable natural resources &ndash; struggle to build a life together despite the objections of their superiors.
