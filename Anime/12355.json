  "description": "The theme of the film is the love between parents and children. The story covers 13 years and begins with a 19-year-old college student named Hana who encounters and falls in \"fairy tale-like\" love with a \"wolf man.\" After marrying the wolf man, Hana gives birth and raises two wolf children&mdash;an older sister named Yuki who was born on a snowy day, and a younger brother named Ame who was born on a rainy day. The four quietly lived in a corner of a city to conceal the existence of the \"wolf children,\" but when the wolf man suddenly dies, Hana decides to move to a rural town far removed from the city.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/y_sadamoto)\n\nYoshiyuki Sadamoto is an animator, illustrator, character designer, and one of the founding members of studio Gainax.\n\nAfter college, Sadamoto learned the ropes of key animation under [Yasuo Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/Yasuo--Otsuka) at Telecom before becoming a founding member of Gainax. Otsuka later named Sadamoto one of the three men more skillful than him. Though Sadamoto is not an unskilled animator by any means, his reputation rests mainly on his iconic character designs, evident in the reception of the Evangelion cast. Nearly all of Gainax' biggest productions have their characters designed by Sadamoto. He is one of the biggest contributors to the general look of Gainax anime and has proven to be massively influential for character designers of future generations.\n\nSadamoto's characters are often thin, fragile and have sharp yet understated facial features. He pays a lot of attention to fashion as well.\n\nMost of Sadamoto's influences are mangaka such as [Katsuhiro Otomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Otomo), [Yoshitaka Amano](https://anilist.co/staff/97967/Yoshitaka-Amano), [Kazuo Umezu](https://anilist.co/staff/97777/Kazuo-Umezu), and [Leiji Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/97597/Leiji-Matsumoto). Sadamoto would go on to author the Evangelion manga. \n\nPost-Gainax he has remained active as character designer, mostly for [Mamoru Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/Mamoru-Hosoda)'s popular feature films. He has also focused on different visual and illustration works, as he worked on several manga and is co-creator and character designer for the .hack game franchise.",

He majored in oil painting at the Kanazawa College of Art in Ishikawa Prefecture. After graduation, Hosoda was able to land an animation job at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/), after submitting a short film that he had animated in his spare time. He initially applied at [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/); though he did not get the job, he received a rejection letter of praise from Hayao Miyazaki himself.\n\nDuring his time at Toei, Hosoda worked his way up, garnering public attention in the early 2000s with the first two films in the Digimon series. It was his first co-directed film, [Digimon: The Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2961/), which attracted the eye of Ghibli head producer [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/).\n\nStudio Ghibli announced that Hosoda was to direct the film [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/) in September 2001. This was scheduled for a summer 2003 release. However, production on the film became strained due to creative differences. According to Hosoda, he \"was told to make the movie similar to how Miyazaki would have made it, but he wanted to make his own film the way he wanted to make it\". In the end, Hosoda left in the summer of 2002 during the early production stages, after failing to come up with a concept acceptable to Studio Ghibli bosses.\n\nProceeding his departure from Ghibli, Hosoda returned to Toei and worked on a few animations in collaboration with artist Takashi Murakami, such as the commercial Superflat Monogram for Louis Vuitton. During this time, he directed an episode of [Ojamajo Doremi](https://anilist.co/anime/353/), which was inspired by his turbulent time at Ghibli. This episode led to him being hired at the animation studio [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), which he worked at from 2005 to 2011.\n\nAt Madhouse, Hosoda earned critical acclaim with his directing efforts. His two movies, [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/) and [Summer Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/5681/), both won the Japan Academy Film Prize award.\n\nIn 2011, Hosoda left Madhouse to establish his own animation studio, [Studio Chizu](https://anilist.co/studio/555/), with Yuuichirou Saitou who produced both previously mentioned award winning shows. As of August 2020, Studio Chizu has released three films directed by Hosoda: 2012's [Wolf Children](https://anilist.co/anime/12355/), 2015's [The Boy and the Beast](https://anilist.co/anime/20981/), and 2018's [Mirai](https://anilist.co/anime/100749/).

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/885163337809395712)\n\nAn irreplaceable member of the Japanese animation industry.\n\nInoue is an animator of the realist school whose skills are among the best in the world. He is known to often handle immense amounts of work in the titles he partakes in. Famous examples being the film [Maquia](https://anilist.co/anime/99457/), where he is responsible for a third of the film's animation, and [The Deer King](https://anilist.co/anime/102891/), in which he was in charge of over 400 layout cuts and 200 key animation cuts at the age of 60.\n\nInoue aspired to become an animator after having seen [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) in 1978 as a high school student, a television series directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). After graduation, Inoue took and failed the entrance exam for [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), an animation studio where Miyazaki was working at the time. He then joined [Studio Junio](https://anilist.co/studio/280/) and debuted as an in-betweener in 1982.\n\nDuring his time at Junio he was heavily inspired by the likes of [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/). A mere two years after his debut, Inoue started attracting attention with his work on [Gu-Gu Ganmo](https://anilist.co/anime/3020/) as a character designer and animation director, and was soon thereafter invited to join the productions of the high profile feature films; [The Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/) as well as [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/), the fifth film of Hayao Miyazaki's. Ever since then he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\n[Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) has praised him as \"the perfect animator,\" who has \"no need for a director.\" Adding that if you had five of him you could make a whole film. [Keiichi Hara](https://anilist.co/staff/104680/) has called him a \"treasure of the anime industry,\" who \"isn't only good, but also fast.\"\n\nInoue also devotes himself to teaching animation to the younger generation. In the early 2000s he presided over a cram school in his name for young animators at [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/), a studio which Inoue still often works with to this day.",

          "description": "Hamasu's animation mainly focuses on character acting, and his scenes often feature minimal camerawork with a heavy emphasis on expressive facial and body animation. Much like [Kouichi Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/121208/), he was heavily influenced by [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/) and the late '80s realism. Early in his career he was employed at Toei Animation, and was thus a recurring presence in the studio's OVA works such as [Xanadu](https://anilist.co/anime/5920/), [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/anime/1153/) and [Vampire Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/1765/). His rising prominence during the early '90s allowed him to participate on [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), and from thereon he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\nIn 1993, Hamasu animated the car chase on [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)’s episode of the [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/). The scene impressed Kon enough for Hamasu to end up as a character designer and animation director on [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/). He was also set to serve a similar role in [Millennium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), but was replaced in the role by [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/) due to having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. He appeared on all of Kon’s films, as well as [Paranoia Agent](https://anilist.co/anime/323/) until the director's passing.\n\nMore recently he has mostly worked on [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) and [Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/)'s films.",
