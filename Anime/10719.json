  "description": "Hasegawa Kodaka has transferred schools, and he's having a hard time making friends. It doesn't help that his blond hair tends to make people think he's a delinquent. One day, he runs into his bad-tempered solitary classmate Yozora while she's talking animatedly to her imaginary friend Tomo. Realizing that neither of them have any actual friends, they decide that the best way to alter this situation is to form a club and start recruiting. <br><br>\nThat is how \"Rinjinbu\", The Neighbours' Club, was formed, a club specifically designed for people who don't have very many friends. As other lonely classmates slowly join their little club, they'll try to learn how to build friendships through cooking together, playing games, and other group activities. But will this group of relationship-challenged misfits really be able to get along?\n",

In July 2020, she married fellow voice actor [Kensho Ono](https://anilist.co/staff/95819), whom she had been dating since 2017. \n\n__Early Career__\nHanazawa originally became a child actress at the age of 8. Amongst other roles, she starred in the well-known TV school show _Appare Sanma Daisensei_ and the TV series _Gakkou no Sensei_. At that time she was contracted to Big Apple, and later to Five Eight and Smile Monkey.\n\n__Voice Acting Career__\nAt the age of 14, she made her voice acting debut in 2003 as Holly in _[Last Exile](https://anilist.co/anime/97/)_. Three years later in 2006, she was selected for a major role in TV Tokyo's anime mecha series _[Zegapain](https://anilist.co/anime/878/)_. She was playing the main character's childhood friend, [Kaminagi Ryouko](https://anilist.co/character/2578/), and her performance was one of the main reasons for the character's popularity amongst fans. It was afterwards that she came under contract at prestigious voice acting talent agency Office Osawa in 2007.\n\nHanazawa went to university in 2007, while at the same time, she began to make her mark as a voice actress. She was voted in 2010 as \"Best Female Voice Actress\" by listeners of the radio program Nonko and Nobita's Anime Scramble. She graduated from university in 2011, and in the same year became a full-time voice actress.\n\nHanazawa won Best Supporting Actress at the 9th Seiyuu Awards for her role as [Kosaki Onodera](https://anilist.co/character/52723/) in _[Nisekoi](https://anilist.co/anime/18897/)_. She also won Newtype's Best Voice Actress award in 2015 and later in 2018.\n\n__Music Career__\nOn February 23, 2012, it was announced that Hanazawa would launch her official website. A few days later, during the Kana Hanazawa Solo Debut Presentation Party event, it was announced that she would release four singles within a year: \"Hoshizora Destination\" on April 25, \"Hatsukoi no Oto\" released on July 18, \"Happy Endings\" on October 24 (an ending theme for _[Zetsuen no Tempest](https://anilist.co/anime/14075/)_), and \"Silent Snow\" on January 16, 2013. Her first album Claire was released on February 20, 2013, and her second album 25 was released on February 26, 2014. She released an album title Blue Avenue in April 2015 and went on a concert tour starting at the Nippon Budokan on May 3. The Blu-ray release of the show, Live Avenue Kana Hanazawa in Budokan, ranked number six in sales.\n\n__Trivia__\n- She was invited to Anime Festival Asia 2010 on stage.\n- She used to be a junior idol in Akihabara where hundreds of people came to watch her, which is how she got her breakthrough for her acting career in commercials before becoming a voice actress.\n\n**Non-anime roles:**\n- [Marie](https://anilist.co/character/89069/Marie) - Persona 4 Golden (VG)\n- Hakari Atsuko - Blue Archive (VG)\n- Illya - Memento Mori (VG)\n- Marian - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Modernia - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\n- Alice Kuonji (Caster) - Fate/Grand Order (VG)",

The show became a hit and Kanae was praised by critics. Since then, she has voiced Amu in other Shugo Chara! franchises including radio serials, drama CDs and video games.  \n\nShe and fellow voice actress Aki Toyosaki are good friends who worked together on several anime including Shugo Chara!, To Love-Ru, The World God Only Knows, Hanasaku Iroha and Toaru Kagaku no Railgun (both also hosted the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun web radio show, Radio no Railgun). \n\nShe was also nominated for \"Best Rookie Voice Actress,\" at the 4th Seiyuu Awards.  \n\nIn January 1st, 2024, she announced on both her blog and Twitter account that she got married to a man from outside the entertainment industry.\n\nNon-Anime Roles:\n\nCampanella - The Legend of Heroes Series (VG)",

          "description": "Akira Amemiya is an animator and up-and-coming director best known for directing [SSSS.GRIDMAN](https://anilist.co/anime/99424/SSSSGRIDMAN) and being Studio Trigger founder [Hiroyuki Imaishi](https://anilist.co/staff/97349/Hiroyuki-Imaishi)'s protege. Amemiya's [animation and directing](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mini-imaishi.mp4) is very similar to Imaishi's yet is less chaotic and contains more 'retro' devices like impact frames and multi-tonal shading, drawing a lot of inspiration from [Masami Obari](https://anilist.co/staff/100660/Masami-Obari). For these reasons he was frequently typecasted for old school pose-heavy mecha combat.\n\nAmemiya is a nerdy director whose anime often heavily references other series and artists he loves, sometimes even replicating Obari's [animation sequences](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dangaioh2.mp4) and [layouts](https://i.imgur.com/nTRdM4K.jpg), [Transformer](https://twitter.com/SSS_SGRID/status/1051063114022572033)'s color designs, and Hideaki Anno's [establishing shots](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/welcome-to-the-anno-class.jpg) as well as long-lingering framing. Amemiya called Anno's [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/30/Evangelion/) his [favorite series before](https://i.imgur.com/nEYK186.png). Between his ode-heavy artistry he interjects personality with [subtle details](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/what-kind-of-brand-is-TOMATO-LIFE-tho.jpg), visual gags, and repurposing tonally contrasting homages into a different context.\n\nAmemiya graduated from Tokyo University of Technology and was part of the university's anime research society. During his time there he became heavily influenced by Osaka University's anime research club [Group CAS](https://twitter.com/group_cas). At the time [Toshiyuki Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/107357/Toshiyuki-Satou) was part of the group, while [Ikehata Hiroshi](https://anilist.co/staff/120505/Ikehata-Hiroshi) visited regularly. After a bit of indie work Amemiya joined studio Gainax and climbed up the hierarchy: from clean-up to animation direction, onto storyboarding and episode directing, until after joining studio Trigger and co-directing Kill la Kill finally having the credentials to debut with his own series.\n\nHe is married to animator [Megumi Kouno](https://anilist.co/staff/120602/Megumi-Kouno).\n\n",

          "description": "Best known as the creator of [Project A-Ko](https://anilist.co/anime/212/). He is particularly noted for his work during the ‘80s, going all out in [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/) and many OVAs and films such as [Outlanders](https://anilist.co/anime/1940/) and [Dirty Pair](https://anilist.co/anime/1796/). He is among the many [Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)-influenced animators of the ‘80s, and his work is recognizable from its wide-eyed characters, attention to anatomical detail, and characterful impact frames.\n\nInitially he wanted to be a mangaka, but enrolled in university instead after not being sure if he could make a living - though, he did drop out after a year. During his short lived time there, he was watching [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and had sent a letter to [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/) with the hopes of joining [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/). They weren’t accepting in-betweeners at this time, so a producer of theirs referred him to [Studio Live](https://anilist.co/studio/6460/), which he then joined after passing an entrance test in 1979. There he studied under the studio’s founder, [Toyoo Ashida](https://anilist.co/staff/110953/), and started gaining attention for his work on Urusei Yatsura.\n\nAfter working at [Studio Deen](https://anilist.co/studio/37/) for a while, he took part in the establishment of Studio Graviton alongside [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), [Shouichi Masuo](https://anilist.co/staff/133909/) and [Kouji Itou](https://anilist.co/staff/101166/). He then went freelance and worked regularly for [Studio Fantasia](https://anilist.co/studio/24/).\n\nLately he has shifted more and more towards directing and storyboarding rather than animating himself, often collaborating with his long-time friends [Yuuji Moriyama](https://anilist.co/staff/100658/) and [Noriyasu Yamauchi](https://anilist.co/staff/112903/).",
