          "description": "[Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/13735228)\n\nArtist and mangaka. Over the years, he's worked as a doujin artist, assistant to an unknown mangaka and anime figurine designer. His two passions include American popculture - with an emphasis on comics and action films - and Japanese history, both of which heavily influence his works. \n\nAccording to an interview published in the Comic Ryu 2011 New Years' booklet, he got his start as an artist in nursery school. He always doodled on the back of pamphlets and picture books, which got him praised by the school's principal and inspired him to pursue a career as an artist.\n\nIn 2010, he won a Silver Ryujin Award (Comic Ryu's newcomer award) for his one-shot *Magoichi ga Ikusa*, which would then be published in the August 2010 issue of Monthly Comic Ryu. His second award-winning work, *Konsei Ou* was published in the January 2011 issue of the same magazine. Later that year, he would get his first manga, KEYMAN, serialized, starting in June of the same year and ending in the February 2017 issue. \n\nHe's also a prolific figure in the Japanese Ninja Slayer fandom, initially contributing large amounts of fanart long before the series recieved a physical release. He was eventually hired to do official illustrations for the novel series, including character designs that would continue to be used in future Ninja Slayer media long after he parted ways with the authors on terms which remain unclear. According to the official wiki, at times he would work on 10-20 character designs and illustrations per month, which earned him the moniker \"Older Brother\" among Ninjaheads.\n\nAccording to his bio, he's so terrible at maths that he tends to forget his own age. In his spare time, he enjoys browsing secondhand bookstores.\n\n",
