  "description": "In some distant future, it's common knowledge that all wolves have been extinct for 200 years. However, it seems this is false as wolves have not disappeared but rather have taken human form. Kiba, a lone wolf, wanders into a city, trying to sniff out the Lunar Flowers that are supposed to lead whoever follows the scent to paradise. The source of the smell is Cheza, a girl who sleeps in what appears to be suspended animation in a lab. She and the wolves are drawn to each other, and Kiba hopes to find paradise once he finds the source of the scent of Lunar Flowers. However, once Kiba finds Cheza, she is kidnapped by a mysterious person called Darcia, and his search begins anew. Before he leaves the city, he meets 3 other wolves, Tsume, Hige and Toboe. All four wolves have very different personalities and ideas, and their friendliness towards each other is a little rough around the edges. However, they soon band together to continue to search for paradise. <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

After switching several studios; from Art Office Sharaku, to Anime Torotoro, to [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), he eventually settled at [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/) with a contract.\n\nNakamura is considered to be among the best action animators, with his scenes featuring catchy movement and effects. Some of his recognizable traits include camera shaking, blurs, and bending and stretching high-speed objects. His fights are praised for its weighty, intense choreographies that are heavy on impact frames. His signature trait is drawing debris as simple cubes, consequentially named \"Yutapon Cubes,\" which are stylistic and easy to draw. Despite being responsible for popularizing it, Nakamura has stated that he started doing it when he noticed [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) doing it. \n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",

[Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/) and Bebow’s founder [Tomonori Kogawa](https://anilist.co/staff/105957/) were also graduates of the same school - the latter whom he would study under after joining the studio. There he made his debut as a key animator on [Seisenshi Dunbine](https://anilist.co/anime/929/) in the following year.\n\nHe left Bebow in the mid ‘80s and joined Pack, a small studio established by [Hiroyuki Kitazume](https://anilist.co/staff/106775/). During this time he was a follower of Kitazume’s, who has said that Onda was the one capable of replicating his drawing’s the best out of the people who worked at studio Pack. After that he joined [Atelier Giga](https://anilist.co/staff/106775/) and worked there until becoming a freelancer.\n\nHis drawings feature western-influenced delicate and sharp linework with an excellent grasp on three-dimensionality. His character art in particular is highly praised both inside and outside of the industry, which he gets to brandish whenever he works as an animation supervisor. He has stated that he prefers character design and supervision work over working as an animator himself.\n\nIn 2003, he took part as a key animator on [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/)'s animated segment in Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" directed by [Kazuto Nakazawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101474/). He is also a huge fan of shoujo manga since a young age due to his older sister.",

One of his first representative works was an independently produced animation titled \"Moonstruck Artemis,\" that he made while part of a manga club during his university days. Aramaki didn't have a special desire to work in the animation industry, but has stated joining it solely because he could draw and the industry had a wide range of options for someone like that. He has also said that the spread of digital technology has made it easier for him to work in both anime and live-action.\n\nIn 2004, Aramaki directed [Appleseed](https://anilist.co/anime/54/), a re-interpretation of a [Shirou Masamune](https://anilist.co/staff/97609/) manga by [the same name](https://anilist.co/manga/30668/). Although bashed by critics, the movie was an influential piece in the medium that had great impact on creators around the world. Studio Ghibli co-founder [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) said the movie would reform the industry.",
