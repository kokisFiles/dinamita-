  "description": "Child of Destruction is the sequel to the RIKI-OH OVA Wall of Hell.  Child of Destruction tells us more of Riki's past, as we flash back to his childhood to learn the terrible fate of his mother and how he himself was taken away from his twin brother Nachi during a game of hide-and-seek, with Nachi's plaintive cry of \"Are you ready yet?\" haunting him through the years. Riki has a six-pointed star emblazoned on his hand, while Nachi has a swastika on his, the significance of which go unexplained. Riki finds himself in the town of Misaki, dotted with illegal nuclear power plants and run by a religious fanatic military organization called \"God's Judgment.\" He is taken prisoner and made to fight in gladiatorial matches in a sprawling arena. He finds his brother, whose special powers have given him the name of \"Savior,\" but his reunion with his resentful sibling turns sour rather quickly. Part 2 is much gorier than Part 1, with Riki smashing his fists into numerous soldier opponents with far less restraint.<br><br>\n(Source: IMDb)",

While doing both of these, he continued to work on his dream job of working on movie production. He acted as the coach for the nine-member volleyball team at Toshiba. Dezaki also began pulling together an anime production team.\n\nDezaki resigned after working for seven years at Toshiba, leaving Hosei University in the middle of a term as well. He began working for [Gisaburou Sugii's](https://anilist.co/staff/103537) company Art Fresh, working alongside his younger brother [Osamu](https://anilist.co/staff/100393). His first works included writing the script for [Attack No.1](https://anilist.co/anime/1550) and storyboarding [Kyojin no Hoshi](https://anilist.co/anime/5834).\n\nIn 1969, Dezaki became a freelancer, doing scripting, production and direction work for [Tokyo Movie Shinsha](https://anilist.co/studio/65), [Tatsunoko Production](https://anilist.co/studio/103), and [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14). In 1977, he founded [Magic Bus](https://anilist.co/studio/207) and produced and animated [Shin Kyojin no Hoshi](https://anilist.co/anime/15875).\n\nHe is the older brother of [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393), and the husband of [Setsuko Shibuichi](https://anilist.co/staff/101935/).",
