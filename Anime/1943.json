He has also won the 1981 Izumi Kyoka award, the 1989 Kawabata Yasunari award, and the 1992 Japan SF award. In 1997, he was decorated as a Chevalier Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.\n\nHis work is known for its dark humour and satirical content. He has often satirized Japanese taboos such as disabilities and the Tenno system, and has been victim to much criticism as a result.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1996, he went on a writing-strike to protest the excessive, self-imposed restraint of Japanese publishers.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/tsutsuiyasutaka)",

While still in college, he debuted as a mangaka with the short Toriko (1984), coming second in the 10th Annual Tetsuya Chiba Awards held by Young Magazine. After graduating, he created the manga Kaikisen (1990) and captured the attention of [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/), who hired Kon to work on his [World Apartment Horror](https://anilist.co/manga/49058/) manga.\n\nHe debuted in the anime industry with [Roujin Z](https://anilist.co/anime/2000/), a movie written by Ootomo who became a great influence on Kon's early career. In 1993, he worked with Mamoru Oshii on [Patlabor 2](https://anilist.co/anime/1096/) as a layout artist, and the two then collaborated on the [Seraphim 266613336 Wings](https://anilist.co/manga/52441/) manga.\n\nHe debuted as an episode director and scriptwriter on the 5th episode of [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/) followed by the short Magnetic Rose, in Ootomo's anthology [Memories](https://anilist.co/anime/1462/). He made his directorial debut with [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/) in 1997.\n\nKon's death by pancreatic cancer was reported on August 24, 2010, shortly before his 47th birthday. Before passing, he composed a final message that was posthumously uploaded to his blog by his family. His last film, [The Dream Machine](https://anilist.co/anime/6585/), remains incomplete.\n\nYounger brother of [Tsuyoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/361096).",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/136171134)\n\nA long-serving anime producer, as well as a founder of [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/) and [Studio M2](https://anilist.co/studio/6137/). He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Much like [Kouichi Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/121208/), he was heavily influenced by [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/) and the late '80s realism. Early in his career he was employed at Toei Animation, and was thus a recurring presence in the studio's OVA works such as [Xanadu](https://anilist.co/anime/5920/), [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/anime/1153/) and [Vampire Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/1765/). His rising prominence during the early '90s allowed him to participate on [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), and from thereon he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\nIn 1993, Hamasu animated the car chase on [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)’s episode of the [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/). The scene impressed Kon enough for Hamasu to end up as a character designer and animation director on [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/). He was also set to serve a similar role in [Millennium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), but was replaced in the role by [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/) due to having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. He appeared on all of Kon’s films, as well as [Paranoia Agent](https://anilist.co/anime/323/) until the director's passing.\n\nMore recently he has mostly worked on [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) and [Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/)'s films.",

          "description": "[Website](http://konstone.s-kon.net) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/konsatoshi)\n\nJapanese manga artist and anime director. \n\nKon studied Graphic Design at Musashino Art University with the intention of becoming a painter. While still in college, he debuted as a mangaka with the short Toriko (1984), coming second in the 10th Annual Tetsuya Chiba Awards held by Young Magazine. After graduating, he created the manga Kaikisen (1990) and captured the attention of [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/), who hired Kon to work on his [World Apartment Horror](https://anilist.co/manga/49058/) manga.\n\nHe debuted in the anime industry with [Roujin Z](https://anilist.co/anime/2000/), a movie written by Ootomo who became a great influence on Kon's early career. In 1993, he worked with Mamoru Oshii on [Patlabor 2](https://anilist.co/anime/1096/) as a layout artist, and the two then collaborated on the [Seraphim 266613336 Wings](https://anilist.co/manga/52441/) manga.\n\nHe debuted as an episode director and scriptwriter on the 5th episode of [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/) followed by the short Magnetic Rose, in Ootomo's anthology [Memories](https://anilist.co/anime/1462/). He made his directorial debut with [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/) in 1997.\n\nKon's death by pancreatic cancer was reported on August 24, 2010, shortly before his 47th birthday. Before passing, he composed a final message that was posthumously uploaded to his blog by his family. His last film, [The Dream Machine](https://anilist.co/anime/6585/), remains incomplete.\n\nYounger brother of [Tsuyoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/361096).",
