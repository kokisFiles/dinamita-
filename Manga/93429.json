          "description": "Kojima Goseki was a Japanese manga artist.\n\nKojima was born on the same day as [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/Osamu-Tezuka). After getting out of junior high school, Kojima painted advertising posters for movie theaters as his source of income. In 1950, he moved to Tokyo. The post-World War II environment lead to forms of manga meant for impoverished audiences. Kojima created art for kamishibai or \"paper play\" narrators. Kojima then started to create works for the kashi-bon market. In 1967, Kojima created Dojinki, his first manga for a magazine. In 1970, he collaborated with writer [Kazuo Koike](https://anilist.co/staff/98020) to create [Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub)](https://anilist.co/manga/30904/Kozure-Ookami/), their most famous work. Koike and Kojima were dubbed \"the Golden Duo\".",

          "description": "__Height__: 183 cm\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kazuo_Koike/)\n\nKoike was a prolific Japanese manga writer, novelist and entrepreneur. \n\nEarly in Koike's career, he studied under *Golgo 13* creator [Takao Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/97907/Takao-Saitou) and served as a writer on the series. \n\nKoike, along with artist Goseki Kojima, made the manga [Kozure Ookami](https://anilist.co/manga/30904/Kozure-Ookami/), and Koike also contributed to the scripts for the 1970s film adaptations of the series, which starred famous Japanese actor Tomisaburo Wakayama. Koike and Kojima became known as the \"Golden Duo\" because of the success of Kozure Ookami.  Another series written by Koike, [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/manga/31449/Crying-Freeman/), which was illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami, was adapted into a 1995 live-action film by French director Christophe Gans.  Kazuo Koike started the Gekika Sonjuku, a college course meant to teach people how to be mangaka.\n\nIn addition to his more violent, action-oriented manga, Koike, an avid golfer, has also written golf manga.",
