  "description": "A modern fantasy based on Japanese Shinto legends. Suzuhara Izumiko is a 15-year-old girl, who has been raised and protected in a shrine deep in the Kumano mountains. She is quite shy and destroys all the electric devices she touches. When she begins to think about going out of the mountains and moving to the city, her guardian Sagara Yukimasa recommends her to enter a high school in Tokyo and forces his son Miyuki to serve Izumiko for life. Miyuki and Izumiko repel each other but their relationship begins to change when a terrifying accident occurs on the school excursion. Izumiko learns her fate as the last representative (yorishiro) of a Himegami goddess and Miyuki learns of his duty as a guardian Yamabushi of Izumiko. <br><br>\n\nNote: Volume 4 contains the side story novel \"Sagara-kun wa Isogashii\" (相楽くんは忙しい)",

          "description": "[Blog](http://andante-d.way-nifty.com/blog/)\n\nNoriko Ogiwara was born in 1959. Having read C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia at a very early age, she decided to become a fantasy writer.\n\nHer first book, Sorairo Magatama won her several awards for children's literature and was translated into English by Cathy Hirano as Dragon Sword and Wind Child; the English version was out-of-print until it was re-released by Viz Media in October 2007. The two sequels, Hakuchou Iden and Usubeni Tennyo, have only been published in Japanese. The re-issuing of Dragon Sword and Wind Child encouraged Viz to publish the next novel in the sequence, Hakuchou Iden, as Mirror Sword and Shadow Prince in May 2011. These three books together are called The Jade Trilogy.\n\nAnother of her works is Nishi no Yoki Majo, a western-styled high fantasy series featuring a girl on the quest of finding out the mysteries surrounding the legends of her country and her friends. Nishi no Yoki Majo has been adapted into a manga series by Haruhiko Momokawa in Comic Blade, and licensed for English publication as The Good Witch of the West.\n\nHer fantasy novel series Red Data Girl was first published in 2008, and was adapted into an anime television series.",
