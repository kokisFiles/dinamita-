          "description": "Yoshifumi Kondou was a Japanese animator who worked for [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) in his last years, and was most known for directing the film [Whisper of the Heart](https://anilist.co/anime/585/). He was expected to become one of the top directors at Studio Ghibli, alongside [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) and [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), and to become their eventual successor.\n\nKondou entered Niigata Prefectural Muramatsu High School in April, 1965, where he was a member of the art club. In the school, one of his seniors was the future manga artist [Kimio Yanagisawa](https://anilist.co/staff/100609/). In April, 1968, he moved to Tokyo after graduating from high school, where he entered Tokyo Design College's animation department. In October, 1968, he began working at [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/), then A Production. There he took part in the production of shows like [Kyojin no Hoshi](https://anilist.co/anime/5834/) and [Lupin III](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/). In 1978, Kondou moved to [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/), where he worked on shows such as [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) and [Anne of Green Gables](https://anilist.co/anime/283/), making his proper character designing debut in the latter.\n\nIn December 1980, Kondou moved to [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), where he served as the character designer for [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/). Kondou resigned from his position at Telecom in March of 1985, and was hospitalized from June through August for a type of pneumonia. He became a contract worker for Nippon Animation afterwards and moved to Studio Ghibli in January, 1987.\n\nIn 1995, he made his directorial debut with the renown Studio Ghibli film, Whisper of the Heart.\n\nKondou suddenly passed away from an aortic dissection on January 21, 1998, which according to doctors had been brought on by overwork. Kondou’s death is also believed to be the reason for Miyazaki’s initial announcement of retirement.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Ootsuka's animation is professional but always full of personality and a special verve. \n\nHe is one of the pillars of [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/)'s animation. Not confined to the Ghibli style, he has always searched for new means of expression, having done everything from the photorealistic to the cartoonish. The wonderful feeling of weight in the movement of Toshio running around the train station in [Only Yesterday](https://anilist.co/anime/1029/), the delightful bodyguards in [The Cat Returns](https://anilist.co/anime/597/), the little robot coming out of the water in the final episode of [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/) - all of these are quintessential Ootsuka. \n\nNone other than the animation director of [Tokyo Godfathers](https://anilist.co/anime/759/) has conceded that the film was originally conceived as a project to showcase Ootsuka's talents, in the same way [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/) was a vehicle for [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/). Most of Ootsuka's scenes in the film were drawn entirely by himself, with no in-betweens, and his cuts which were the first finished, had a determining influence on the direction of the animation by the rest of the animators. \n\n(Source: [Pelleas](http://www.pelleas.net/animators/#20))",
