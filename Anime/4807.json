He was thus selected to be character designer for the sequel, [Yoroiden Samurai Troopers Gaiden](https://anilist.co/anime/1265/), and later animation director for the [Mobile Suit Gundam F91](https://anilist.co/anime/88/) movie. \n\nSince then he's been heavily involved in Sunrise productions, both as animator and as character designer. Notable examples of his designs are those for [Mobile Suit Gundam Wing](https://anilist.co/anime/90/) and [Argento Soma](https://anilist.co/anime/285/).\n\nHe had his debut as a director with [Witch Hunter Robin](https://anilist.co/anime/7/), after which he directed the acclaimed [Ergo Proxy](https://anilist.co/anime/790/). More recent works of his include the adaptation of [Gangsta](https://anilist.co/anime/20773/), as well as the [Mobile Suit Gundam Hathaway](https://anilist.co/anime/105595/) trilogy.\n\n__Notable works outside Anime:__\n\n- Final Fantasy IX (Video Game, 2000) (Character Design)",
