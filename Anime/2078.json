          "description": "Shirow studied oil painting at Osaka University of Arts. While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, Black Magic, which was published in the manga dōjinshi Atlas. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.\n\nThe result was best-selling manga Appleseed, a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of Black Magic and a second volume of Appleseed, he released Dominion in 1986. Two more volumes of Appleseed followed before he began work on Ghost in the Shell.\n\nIn 2007, he collaborated again with Production I.G to co-create the original concept for the anime television series Shinreigari/Ghost Hound, Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with Production I.G began airing in April 2008, titled Real Drive.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Because of their husky voice, they are often typecast as either young men and boys or tomboyish females. It is also because of this that they are sometimes referred as \"Aniki\" (big brother) by fans.\n\nIn a speech at the 16th Seiyu Awards on March 5, 2022, Ogata had shared that they had been wary to accept \"Best Leading Actress\" as they mostly played boy characters and do not refer to themselves as an actress. Ogata also shared that \"There is so much talk about being 'genderless' nowadays and there are voice actors in the industry who have come out. And like myself, there are people out there who go on about their daily lives mostly not thinking of themselves as women.\"\n\n__Non-Anime Roles:__\n\n- Fidelio Aureus Magnus - Metaphor: ReFantazio (VG)",
