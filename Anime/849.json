  "description": "Kyon, your typical high school student, has long given up his belief in the supernatural. However, upon meeting Haruhi Suzumiya, he quickly finds out that it is the supernatural that she is interested in; aliens, time travelers and espers among other things. When Haruhi laments about the lack of intriguing clubs around school, Kyon inspires Haruhi to form her own club. As a result, the SOS Brigade is formed, a club which specializes in all that is the supernatural.<br><br>\nMuch to his chagrin, Kyon, along with the silent bookworm, Yuki Nagato, the shy and timid Mikuru Asahina, and the perpetually smiling Itsuki Koizumi, are recruited as members. The story follows the crazy adventures that these four endure under their whimsical leader, Haruhi. The story is based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa.<br><br>\n<i>Note: This entry is for the original 14-episode 2006 airing. The series was further expanded and reordered into <a href=\"https://anilist.co/anime/4382/Suzumiya-Haruhi-no-Yuuutsu-2009/\">a 28-episode series in 2009.</a>",

He graduated from the Faculty of Law in Kwansei Gakuin University. After graduating from university, he became a manager at a women's clothing store but decided to quit to pursue a writing career.\n\nHe would spend time being unemployed and reading books at the library, until he made his debut in March 2003 with his novel \"Dengeki!! Aegis 5\" in the magazine \"Dengeki Moeou\". That same year, two of his other novels [Escape From School!](https://anilist.co/manga/40275/Gakkou-wo-Deyou/) and [The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi](https://anilist.co/manga/33083/Suzumiya-Haruhi-Series/) were released, with The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi winning the Sneaker Taisho literary prize.\n\nHis work is strongly influenced by the science fiction novels he read while in middle school. He has mentioned that authors who influenced him in particular were [Hideyuki Kikuchi](https://anilist.co/staff/97323/Hideyuki-Kikuchi/), [Baku Yumemakura](https://anilist.co/staff/97026/Baku-Yumemakura/), [Ellery Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellery_Queen), [Van Dine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._S._Van_Dine), [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov), as well as the director of [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/Urusei-Yatsura/), [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/Mamoru-Oshii/).",

She worked at [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/) from 2004 to 2020. \n\nYamada enjoyed drawing as a child and would copy images from the [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/) and [Dragon Ball](https://anilist.co/anime/223/) series. She joined the volleyball club in primary school and the tennis and photography clubs in high school. At the Kyoto University of Art and Design, she studied oil painting and was a member of the special effects club. She intended to work in film after university, but instead decided to join Kyoto Animation after seeing an advertisement. Her first assignment at the studio was drawing in between frames for [Inuyasha](https://anilist.co/anime/249/), which Kyoto Animation helped produce. She was eventually promoted to a key animator for [Air](https://anilist.co/anime/101/).\n\nAfter working as an episode director of [Clannad](https://anilist.co/anime/2167/), she was asked to make her chief directorial debut with [K-ON!](https://anilist.co/anime/5680/), an adaptation of a slice-of-life manga. The series was very successful, spurring a second season and a film. In 2013, she directed [Tamako Market](https://anilist.co/anime/16417/), and followed it with the film [Tamako Love Story](https://anilist.co/anime/20519/) in 2014. For Tamako Love Story, she was awarded the New Face Award at the Japan Media Arts Festival. She storyboarded the entire film herself, and also wrote the lyrics for the opening theme song, “Everybody Loves Somebody.”\n\nYamada's next project was the feature film [A Silent Voice](https://anilist.co/anime/20954/), an adaptation of [Yoshitoki Ooima](https://anilist.co/staff/105951/)’s manga by the same name. The film reflected on elements of bullying and physical impairment in Japan. The film opened at #2 in the Japanese Box Office and grossed a total of ¥2.3 billion (~$21.7m USD), the 19th highest-grossing film in Japan in 2016. The film also received multiple award nominations, including Best Animation Film in the Mainichi Film Awards and the Excellent Animation of the Year in the Japan Academy Prize.\n\nFor Yamada, the most important part of being a director is to observe people. She describes herself as a \"method\" director, emphasizing the minds of the characters.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
