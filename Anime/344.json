  "description": "When Kamogawa Asumi was just a baby, her mother was grievously injured when a rocket crashed to the ground. Five years later, having been in a coma all the time, Asumi's mother finally dies, and the little girl struggles to come to terms with the death of a mother she barely remembers. In the midst of her turmoil, she meets \"Lion-san\", a strange figure wearing a lion mask and claiming to be a ghost. Lion-san helps Asumi to bury her mother's ashes, and finally, Asumi reaches her own decision: \"When I grow up, I'm going to be a rocket pilot.\"\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

They released their first single \"Kujira\" in 2004. They are well known for the song \"Be Somewhere\", used as the opening theme of the anime series Rockman EXE Stream, back in 2005. They also performed the opening theme song for Twin Spica, \"Venus Say\", a version of \"Kujira\" with different lyrics. The group's name stands for \"Blend, Unique, Zipping, and You just wait.\" Many of their songs were written and composed by Porno Graffitti guitarist and lyricist Haruichi Shindou. Buzy disbanded in June 2006. Members Nao, Akiko, Mayumi and Mao went on to form MANSAKU with former Boystyle members Kayoko and Yukina.  \n\nMembers: \nNao Toyama (當山奈央, B.
