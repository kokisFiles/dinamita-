  "description": "Hard-boiled, cocky, classy and silly. These words only begin to describe the amazing master thief Lupin the Third. With the help of some quick gunplay by his partner Jigen, Lupin takes on the world in elaborate heists, classic car chases, and nasty explosions. Fujiko, a buxom redhead with a penchant for betrayal, always gets tangled up in Lupin's capers. The stoic but swift swordsman Goemon is just as inclined to kill Lupin as he is to help him. And Lupin can never seem to lose the relentless Tokyo Police Inspector Zenigata. What sort of trouble will this band of misfits get into next?<br><br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",

          "description": "__Residency:__ Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan\n__Graduated:__ Gakushuin University (Department of Economics)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, script/screenwriter, author, mangaka and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He is the second of four brothers, and was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyou Ward. He is best known for his international fame as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of astonishing animated feature films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\n\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014, as well as having won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature, the only instances in which a non-English-language film has won the award. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n__Biography:__\nMiyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, which led to him eventually joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation) in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with the director [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/Isao-Takahata). Some notable films Miyazaki contributed to at Toei include [Doggie March](https://anilist.co/anime/9228/Wan-Wan-Chuushingura/) and [Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/2833/Gullivers-Travels-Beyond-the-Moon/). He provided key animation in other films at Toei, such as the Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to animation studio A-Pro in 1971, where he would co-direct the movie Lupin the Third Part I alongside Isao Takahata. After moving to Zuiyou Eizou (later dubbed [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/Nippon-Animation)) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/Future-Boy-Conan/). He joined [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/Telecom-Animation-Film)/Tokyo Movie Shinsa in 1979 to direct his first feature films, [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/) in 1979 and [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/) in 1984, as well as the television series [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/Sherlock-Hound/).\n\nMiyazaki co-founded [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/Studio-Ghibli) in 1985. He would go on to direct numerous of films with Ghibli, including [Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/Castle-in-the-Sky/) (1986), [My Neighbor Totoro](https://anilist.co/anime/523/My-Neighbor-Totoro/) (1988), [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/Kikis-Delivery-Service/) (1989), and [Porco Rosso](https://anilist.co/anime/416/Porco-Rosso/) (1992). The films they made were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. His film [Princess Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/Princess-Mononoke/) was the first animated film to ever win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and it briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997, and its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Studio Ghibli's popularity and influence outside of Japan. His 2001 film [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/Spirited-Away/) became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films, [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/) (2004), [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/Ponyo/) (2008), and [The Wind Rises](https://anilist.co/anime/16662/The-Wind-Rises/) (2013) also enjoyed critical and commercial success.\n\nFollowing the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned again in 2016 to work on a new feature film, [The Boy and The Heron](https://anilist.co/anime/109979/The-Boy-and-the-Heron/) (2023). The film received critical acclaim, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and the second non-English-language film, after Spirited Away, to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards. According to Studio Ghibli vice-president [Junichi Nishioka](https://anilist.co/staff/212700/Junichi-Nishioka) and long-time colleague, [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/Toshio-Suzuki), Miyazaki is reportedly working on another feature film, contrary to rumours that The Boy and the Heron would be his last.",

From 1959, he wrote for a publishing company specializing in rental books under the pen name \"Kazuhiko Katou,\" while working on doujins with his younger brother, Teruhiko Katou, and another friend. After moving to Tokyo, he was influenced by the American parody magazine \"MAD,\" and his style changed to an American comic book style. This caught the attention of Fumito Shimizu, editor-in-chief of Futabasha, and in 1966 he made his full-fledged debut with Playboy Nyuumon under the pen name Eiji Muta. Under the name of \"Mania Group,\" it was made to look as if Senji Mashuu (摩周仙二) and Eiji Kirita (霧多永二) were participating, but in reality, Katou wrote the whole story by himself.\n\nIn 1966, under the orders of editor-in-chief Shimizu, he changed his pen name to Monkey Punch. Katou didn't like the name because it was given to a newcomer at random, and he planned to change it after about a year, but he couldn't change it because the work he published under this name the following year became a big hit.\n\nIn May 1967, he was selected to draw the cover art for \"Zengan Manga Story Action Tokushuu-gou,\" which was published mainly for newcomers to \"Manga Story,\" such as Baron Yoshimoto and Ken Tsukikage, and he continued to draw the cover art for \"Shuukan Manga Action,\" a weekly seinen manga magazine that was newly launched in August with Shimizu as editor-in-chief. He also began serializing Lupin III under the title with the notation \"Original by [Leblanc](https://anilist.co/staff/122907/).\" in the August 10 first issue of Manga Action.\n\nIn addition to Lupin III, he has also created works such as Fukushuu Daikou, [Cinderella Boy](https://anilist.co/manga/71117/), and [MUSASHI: Gundou](https://anilist.co/anime/1200/). In 1996, he took on the challenge of directing an animated film with [Lupin III: Dead or Alive](https://anilist.co/anime/1416/).\n\nHe passed away due to pneumonia on April 11, 2019.\n\n**Awards:**\n- Inkpot Award\n- Rome Comic Festival ROMICS Gold Award\n- AMD Award for Merit\n- Japan Cartoonists Association Award Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Isao Takahata was a Japanese director, screenwriter, producer and one of the founders of [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/). Takahata earned international critical acclaim for his work as a director of anime films such as, [Grave of the Fireflies](https://anilist.co/anime/578/), [Only Yesterday](https://anilist.co/anime/1029/), [Pom Poko](https://anilist.co/anime/1030/), [My Neighbors the Yamadas](https://anilist.co/anime/415/) and [The Tale of the Princess Kaguya](https://anilist.co/anime/16664/).\n\nTakahata graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1959 with a degree in French literature. Around this time he had seen the French film The King and the Mockingbird, which led him to become interested in animation as a medium. A friend suggested for him to apply for a directing job at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/); Takahata passed their entrance exam, and was hired as an assistant director for several of Toei's works, including [Wolf Boy Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/17521/), on which he was mentored by [Yasuo Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/). Ootsuka eventually asked Takahata to direct a film of his own, thus he made his directorial debut in 1968 with the film [The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun](https://anilist.co/anime/1044/). A Toei employee named [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) served as a key animator in the film. Though it would later be recognized as one of the first defining works of modern Japanese animation, the film was a commercial failure, and Takahata was demoted.\n\nUnable to further improve his standing at Toei, Takahata left the studio in 1971, along with Miyazaki and [Youichi Kotabe](https://anilist.co/staff/115532/). Takahata and Miyazaki came up with the idea of creating an animated feature film based on the stories of Pippi Longstocking, and the duo had developed a number of storyboards and had flown out to Sweden for location shots and to meet with the books' author, [Astrid Lindgren](https://anilist.co/staff/140833/), and secure the rights for the character. However, they could not reach an agreement and were forced to drop the project. Takahata and Miyazaki remained collaborators in several other animation projects through the 1970s, including taking over production of the anime series [Lupin the Third](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/). \n\nNot long afterwards, Takahata, Kotabe, and Miyazaki were approached by the studio Zuiyo to create an animated series based on the novel Heidi, which resulted in [Heidi, Girl of the Alps](https://anilist.co/anime/2225/). Zuiyo later became [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/), which Takahata and Miyazaki joined. Takahata's work there included a World Masterpiece Theater adaptation of [Anne of Green Gables](https://anilist.co/anime/283/). Nearly a decade later around 1981, Takahata left Nippon to join [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/).\n\nConcurrent to these events, Miyazaki had made his own directorial debut in the Lupin III feature film [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/) in 1979, which was a critical success. Inspired by this, Miyazaki then began developing his own manga, [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/manga/30651/), and directing its 1984 [film adaption](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), which also was commercially and critically successful. Miyazaki then approached Takahata with the idea of co-founding their own animation studio based on the success of Nausicaä. And thus, Studio Ghibli was formed in 1985 by Miyazaki, Takahata, and Miyazaki's collaborators [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) and [Yasuyoshi Tokuma](https://anilist.co/staff/157040/).\n\nThe studio primarily released animated feature films that were directed by Miyazaki, with Takahata serving as producer or in other roles. Takahata also directed several Studio Ghibli films himself. His first, Grave of the Fireflies, released in 1988, was based on the semi-autobiographical short story of the same name written by Akiyuki Nosaka. Takahata was also partially inspired by his own experiences from the bombing of Okayama City, which he and his family had survived through back in 1945. The film received critical acclaim for its emotional impact and anti-war themes and is considered the film that established the international esteem of Studio Ghibli. Takahata went on to direct four more Ghibli films throughout his career. He was nominated for an Oscar in the category of Best Animated Feature Film at the 87th Academy Awards for The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.\n\nTakahata had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and died on April 5, 2018, at a hospital in Tokyo, at the age of 82. On May 15, 2018, a farewell ceremony for Takahata was held at the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. Hayao Miyazaki publicly spoke for the first time about Takahata's death, saying \"I was convinced that Paku-san [Takahata's nickname] would live to be 95 years old, but he unfortunately passed away. It makes me think my time is also limited... Thank you, Paku-san.\"\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He was planning to go to art college, but was invited to join Mushi Pro, so he quit high school and joined the company. He participated as an animator for the first [Astro Boy](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/) series. In 1967, he participated in the founding of _Art Fresh with Gisaburou Sugii and Osamu Dezaki_. After working as an animator on Mushi Production's [Gokuu no Daibouken](https://anilist.co/anime/2687/), which Art Fresh participated in, he worked as a freelance animator before becoming a senior director and board member of Dyna-Method Inc.\n\nIn addition to serving as episode director, storyboard artist and writer, he also worked as a director. He has participated in [Tensai Bakabon](https://anilist.co/anime/6468/), [Star of the Giants](https://anilist.co/anime/5834/), [Ashita no Joe](https://anilist.co/anime/2402/), [Moomin](https://anilist.co/anime/8234/), [Lupin III](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/), [Invincible Super Man Zambot 3](https://anilist.co/anime/2200/), [Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3](https://anilist.co/anime/3305/), and [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/).\n\nIn addition to anime, he created, wrote and directed Star Guardian with Airship Theater Company, wrote the screenplays for Tanoshii Moomin Ikka and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and wrote and directed The Wizard of Oz. It all started when he was asked by director [Masaaki Oosumi](https://anilist.co/staff/122102/) to help with the screenplay of Aladdin for Airship Theater Company's Aladdin when he was working on the TV adaptation of Moomin. In addition, he has worked on commercials, events, performances and novels. He has been a fan of science fiction since he read Shounen Shoujo Sekai Kagaku Bouken Zenshuu by Kodansha when he was a kid.\n\nOne of the reasons that the 100th episode of the [Kirby: Right Back at Ya!](https://anilist.co/anime/2390/) anime contained some problems, inconsistencies, and heavy-handedness in the plot and development is that Yoshikawa, who wrote the final episode, learned that his wife was in critical condition at the time and had to rush through the script and leave it in incomplete form in order to be present for her dying moments.\n\n[Yasuo Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/) cited in an interview for the Lupin III Perfect Book: Complete Collector's Edition, that [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), Osamu Dezaki, and Yoshikawa as representative members of the Japanese anime world.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n",

He got his start in the entertainment industry as the leader of a puppet theater in Kobe. This led to an association with Tokyo Movie Shinsha, one of the first Japanese animation studios. In 1969, Oosumi collaborated with animator [Yasuo Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/) in the [Moomin](https://anilist.co/anime/8234/) TV series, which was an immediate hit. But Finnish author [Tove Jansson](https://anilist.co/staff/107473/), creator of the Moomin books, objected strongly to the depiction of the characters in the series. According to Jansson, \"My Moomin is No car, No fight, and No money.\" The series was shifted to another studio after 26 episodes.\n\nAlso in 1969, he collaborated with Otsuka on the classic [Lupin III](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/) TV series. This series opened to poor ratings and was cancelled after only 23 episodes. Oosumi directed the first seven episodes and episodes nine and twelve, with the remaining episodes being directed jointly by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) and [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/). Oosumi was fired by the studio for refusing to adapt the sophisticated series for a children's audience. He went on to direct film and television animations for a number of other studios, and for the national broadcaster NHK. In 1993, he returned to direct one more Lupin episode, entitled [Voyage to Danger](https://anilist.co/anime/1438/).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
