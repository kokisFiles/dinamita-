          "description": "__[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hiro_mashima)__ | __[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQLYbIvGWtClestisnB1_6A)__\n\nJapanese manga artist most known for his manga Groove Adventure Rave, published by Kodansha's Weekly Shonen Magazine, from 1999 to 2005. The series was later adapted into an anime. However, the anime adaption was cancelled before it could complete the series.\n\nIn 2003, he collected some of his one-shot titles in two volumes: Mashima-en- Vol.1 & 2. Those stories include, among others, Cocona, \"Xmas Hearts\" and \"Fairy Tail\", a sort of prototype for his last work.\n\nIn 2006, he began his now finished series, Fairy Tail, serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shonen Magazine. He also published the manga Monster Hunter Orage.\n\nHiro Mashima was a notable guest at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con. He has one daughter.\n\nHis artwork and [Oda Eiichiro](https://anilist.co/staff/96881/EiichiroOda)'s are greatly similar, but that is due to both of them being influenced largely by [Toriyama Akira](https://anilist.co/staff/96901/AkiraToriyama)'s work growing up.\n\nHis former assistant was [Yoshikawa Miki](https://anilist.co/staff/98703/MikiYoshikawa) author of Yankee-kun to Megane-chan.",
