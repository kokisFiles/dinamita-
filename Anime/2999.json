          "description": "[Official Website](https://tezukaosamu.net)\n\nOsamu Tezuka was a legendary Japanese Mangaka and Doctor of Medicine. Tezuka made his manga debut in 1946 with [The Diary of Ma-chan](https://anilist.co/manga/52202) (マアちゃんの日記帳, Machan no Nikkicho) for the children's newspaper Mainichi Shogakusei Shinbun (Mainichi Elementary Schoolchildren's Newspaper) while he was a student at Osaka University. His breakout work, '[New Treasure Island](https://anilist.co/manga/41273)' (新宝島, Shin Takarajima) was in 1947, followed three years later by '[Jungle Emperor](https://anilist.co/manga/31771)' (ジャングル大帝, Jungle Taitei), which was serialized in Manga-Shonen.\n\nFrom a very young age, Osamu Tezuka had been a great fan of Disney animation. Tezuka was also very successful in the animation field. Not only did he do the first TV anime ([Astroboy](https://anilist.co/anime/2747), 1963), but he also produced the first Japanese color anime series ([Jungle Emperor](https://anilist.co/anime/1572), 1965). Influenced by Disney and old movies, Tezuka has in turn influenced countless numbers of Japanese mangaka. Tezuka's works are being reprinted again and again, earning him the undisputed title of 'God of Manga.' In 1994, the city of Takarazuka, where he grew up, inaugurated The Osamu Tezuka Manga Museum. And in 1997, postage stamps with his artwork were sold in Japan.\n\nIn 1971 the semi-annual Tezuka awards were established by the magazine Weekly Shonen Jump. In 1997 a different award named after Tezuka, namely the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, was brought into life.\n\nThe impact Tezuka has had on Japanese Manga is almost impossible to exaggerate, because he created the present form of the medium. Maybe it stems from his medical education or from the Japanese character, but Tezuka had an enormous respect for life. This respect is a theme that can be traced throughout his work, reflected in his life's work, '[Phoenix](https://anilist.co/manga/31325)'. He has reportedly made about 150,000 pages of manga in his life, and has been awarded many prizes for his efforts. Many of Tezuka's work have been translated into English as well as French, Italian, Korean, and so forth. Other characters Osamu Tezuka created include [Unico](https://anilist.co/manga/47240) and [Black Jack](https://anilist.co/manga/31600).\n\nIn 1989 an asteroid was named after Tezuka and [Toshio Ban](https://anilist.co/staff/127281), one of Tezuka's former assistants serialized a manga biography entitled The Osamu Tezuka Story (手塚治虫物語, Osamu Tezuka Monogatari and it was released in English in 2016.\n\nHe is considered the Japanese equivalent to [Walt Disney](https://anilist.co/staff/139600), who served as a major inspiration during his formative years. His prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as \"the Father of Manga\" and \"the Godfather of Manga\".\n\n(Sources: MangaUpdates, Wikipedia)",

Lensman was the first series he worked on as an animator. The first anime movies that he worked on were Kamui no Ken and Bobby ni Kubittake. \n\nIn 1989, he made his debut as an episode director with Yawara! and soon made his full directorial debut in 1995 with Memories.

          "description": "Hirata Toshio is an animator and a graduate of Musashino Art University. After graduation in 1961 he joined Toei Douga, but left it soon after. Since then he has worked for Mushi Production, Zuiyo, Group Tac, and currently resides in Madhouse.\n\nLike many of the figures of this period, Hirata started his career as an animator at Toei Doga as an inbetweener in the features made from 1960 to 1963: Journey to the West, Anju, Sinbad, Little Prince. Specifically, he was under the tutelage of Yasuji Mori. Hirata still speaks extremely highly of the experience and of Mori in particular, going so far as to say that if it hadn't been for Mori, he probably wouldn't be in animation today. Mori was a major influence on Hirata -- as well as many of those who worked with him like Miyazaki and Takahata -- not only because he was a great teacher and animator himself, but also because he was a gentle person who, legend has it, never got angry at anyone. He took animation seriously, and approached it with rigor and love. Mori's legacy is clearly at the root of Hirata's pliant, honest, soulful approach to animation.  One of the things that is unique about this early period is the variety of origins of the animators. In other words, today people come to anime because they've seen anime; but back then, during the early Toei Doga period, there was no TV anime, so many of the people who entered Toei Doga did so because they had seen a few Disney pics in the theater, or animated ads on TV, or Hakujaden, etc.. Yet other people simply happened to wander in almost by accident, having studied art at school, and maybe having casually seen an animated film or two, but otherwise knowing nothing about animation. Toshio Hirata falls into the latter group.  Anime then was not yet anime; it was a bunch of young people making tentative steps to figure out what they could do with animation. They were blissfully free of the burdensome history that nowadays blinkers many in the anime industry. Thus could we get films like Little Prince &amp; the 8-Headed Dragon and Gulliver's Space Travels that are full of inventive artistic ideas. Hirata was one of the many people just out of art school who happened to find their way to Toei Doga for whatever reason. Together with a lot of those people, he was drawn to the Animation Sannin no Kai during his Toei Doga period, 1960-1963. If he learned the traditional approach to animation at Toei Doga, the experience of seeing those films broadened his understanding of animation and added an artistic side to his approach. The graphically-oriented aspect of his subsequent output can definitively be traced to this experience.  Hirata began his Mushi Pro period in 1966 directing episodes of Jungle Taitei immediately after his involvement in Ken the Wolf Boy at Toei Doga in 1965. His experience at Mushi Pro was a fateful one for him, second to his experience at Toei Doga only in chronological order. Interestingly enough, at Mushi Pro he was automatically started out as a key animator, and the very next year, for Jungle Taitei in 1966, he was bumped up to directing! Ironically, when he helped out on Toei Doga's Gulliver around the same time in 1965, he was bumped back to inbetweening. Apparently credit wasn't transferrable between studios. This is basically attributable to the rather unique system at Mushi Pro that reflected Tezuka's creator-based approach. Tasks weren't clear-cut and heirarchically organized the way they were at Toei Doga; people did various things as necessary, and consequently accession to key animation and directing could be absurdly fast (though, really, the reason for the ad-hoc nature of the studio basically comes down to the shortage of staff).",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/136171134)\n\nA long-serving anime producer, as well as a founder of [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/) and [Studio M2](https://anilist.co/studio/6137/). He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Shigeyuki Hayashi, better known by his pseudonym Rintarou, is a well-known anime director.\n\nA film buff ever since he was a kid, he wanted to pursue a career in filmmaking. After having worked as a cel painter in commercial animation, he joined [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/) in 1958 for a brief time working on films such as [Hakujaden](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and [Saiyuuki](https://anilist.co/anime/4481/). After having been told that he couldn't work as a director due to not being a college graduate, he moved to [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) - making his directorial debut as one of the regular episode directors on [Tetsuwan Atom](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/).\n\nIn 1972, Rintarou left Mushi Pro to go freelance and to co-found [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11) together with [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/). A few years later, Rintarou got invited to direct [Jetter Mars](https://anilist.co/anime/6087/) at his previously disinterested workplace, Toei Animation. He accepted the offer but didn't join the studio as an employee, making him one of the few people who've directed for the studio while not being an inhouse employee. He continued to direct multiple entries for Toei, including [Arrow Emblem](https://anilist.co/anime/3800/), [Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/), as well as the 1979 film [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1301/), which is still considered by many as his best work.\n\n[Haruki Kadokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170354/), the president of [Kadokawa Shoten](https://anilist.co/studio/113/), took notice of the commercial success of Rintarou's works and hired him to direct [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/), which was the very first film produced by Kadokawa. The animation production was handled by Madhouse, where Rintarou changed his post at this time. There he continued his directorial efforts with numerous films and OVA series.\n\nThe older brother of [Masayuki Hayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/161046/).",
