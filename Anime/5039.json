Kurou flees into the mountains after losing to his brother Minamoto no Yoritomo, the first Shogun to rule all of Japan. History records that he committed suicide, but instead, Kurou meets a strange, beautiful woman named Kuromitsu in her mountain hermitage. Eventually, Kurou falls in love with Kuromitsu, but then realizes she conceals a dark secret. He learns that he is unable to die and continues to live for a thousand years as Japan evolves into a future society.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/265406784) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tetsuro.araki.75)\n\nJoined [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/MADHOUSE) in 1999 as a production manager, making his storyboard and episode director debut with [Galaxy Angel](https://anilist.co/anime/383/) just two years later. In 2005, he made his proper directorial debut with [Otogi-juushi Akazukin](https://anilist.co/anime/402/), a single-episode OVA which was aimed more at figure collectors than at anime fans. Its popularity birthed the full-length series and manga which both came out afterwards.\n\nIn 2006, Araki helmed his first big project with [Death Note](https://anilist.co/anime/1535/), which gained him international praise. He has since gone on to direct numerous series from originals such as [Guilty Crown](https://anilist.co/anime/10793/) and [Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress](https://anilist.co/anime/21196/), to the massively successful adaptation of [Attack on Titan](https://anilist.co/anime/16498/), whose production Araki left with the studio change.\n\nHe's been close friends with [Takayuki Hirao](https://anilist.co/staff/102247/) since their days at [MADHOUSE](https://anilist.co/studio/11/).
