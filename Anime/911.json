  "description": "With only Coast School in mind, Takamine Kiyomaro leaves Gash bewildered that he&rsquo;ll make a new Volcan 300 for him to play with. The genius tries to catch up with the bus that would take him there, but a giant Volcan 300 kidnaps him. Meanwhile Gash befriends the same Vulcan that kidnapped Kiyomaro later named: Volcan 300 Generation 4. The genius wakes up to see that he isn&rsquo;t in Coast School, but that a doctor by the name M2 wants him to be his partner in the future. However, Gash and the other demons interfere with M2's plan in taking Kiyomaro to the future by the help of Generation 4 who agreed to take Gash there by a glitch in its system. Still the doctor tries to get Kiyomaro to come back with him, but with the help of everyone, he is defeated. Though a new situation is at hand, the time warp that M2 came from is out of control. It&rsquo;s up to Gash and the others to save the city or be sucked into it.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",
