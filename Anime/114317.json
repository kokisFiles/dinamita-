  "description": "Lang Wu Yao is a boy born with a supernatural singing voice. Secluded in the snowy mountains, he is put through severe training by his blind mother. Her wish is for her son's voice to be unrivaled, so that it will be heard by the imperial court. But the intense training results in a tragic accident, where she dies. Left an orphan as a result, Lang wanders the land. His voice is used as a tool by the wicked and greedy, with his heart being ground down in the process. Eventually his strange singing catches the ear of the princess of Xi You, and Lang is elevated to the stage his mother had dreamt of. But what awaits him is a life or death battle performance against other musicians for the amusement of the members of the court. Until one day, Lang learns of the rumors of the Sword Plundering Nemesis, an infamous bandit known through all of Xi You for stealing magical weapons. What he doesn't know is that the  next weapon in the sights of this thief has been hidden by the emperor in the same castle Lang has been performing in.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
