          "description": "Raised by his mother in difficult circumstances due to absence of his father who disappeared. After primary school, he had to work. He didn't feel well in his adolescence and at the age of 14 he embarks as a stowaway on a cargo ship for the United States, but is found by the coastal guards. At 16, he begins drawing for small rental libraries. This market, a parallel market, to the normal manga market, disappeared in the following decade which left him without a job. Poverty (he even sold his own blood) led him to suicide attempts.\n\nHe got a new chance on Garo magazine in 1965. From then on, he presents his works, real masterpieces, in this magazine. Tsuge has always tried to break through the way of telling a story established by [Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938).\n\nFrom 1966 to 1976, he travels through all of Japan, visiting the small villages, uninhabited regions and other places unknown to the public. This is where he gets a lot of ideas for new stories.\n\nTsuge wrote three categories of stories: those who he called \"travel stories\" which came from his numerous voyages across Japan. Secondly, stories coming from his dreams with a surreal atmosphere. Thirdly, autobiographical stories, published mainly in the seventies and eighties.\n\nDepression has halted Tsuge's career several times, and today he doesn't draw anymore. Even so, his works are timeless and get reprinted since the sixties even though he isn't an author known to the masses. Critics are unanimously positive about his works and about his inestimable importance for the manga scene. Two of his works have been made into a movie. He's considered to be a cult-mangaka.",

          "description": "In the late 1950's, Yoshihiro Tatsumi began using the visual language of manga to tell gritty, literary stories about the private lives of everyday people. He has been called \"the grandfather of Japanese alternative comics\". Recently his works have been seeing a resurgence of popularity, and he has been published in many languages.    Tatsumi is widely credited with starting the gekiga ( 劇画, 'dramatic pictures' ) style of alternative comics in Japan, having allegedly coined the term in 1957. He has thus influenced comic artists around the world.\n\nGekiga is a more serious and realistic style than that of manga, which at the time was aimed toward children. The mainstream publications out of Tokyo produced the manga style, but the main support for the gekiga alternative comic style were the lending libraries out of Osaka. Over time, those who grew up reading manga wanted something more adult, and gekiga filled that need. The 1960's generation of Japanese youth became known as the Manga Generation; it was a sign of rebellion, and gekiga comics were central to that, including political movements espoused by the young.\n\nEventually the style had grown in popularity to the point that it influenced people like Osamu Tezuka (who was iconic of the mainstream manga style). This acceptance of varied styles in manga engendered the period called The Golden Age of Manga, which extended from the 1970's into the 1980's. Today, with the development of new schools of alternative comics in Japan, the influence of gekiga is declining, but it still appears, mostly in seinen comics.",

She completed her high school and moved to Tokyo. In Tokyo, she started drawing shoujo manga under the name Hazama Kuniko (はざまくにこ) at Kodansha and Wakagi Shobo. \n\nHowever, she gradually distanced from that art style, and stopped drawing shoujo manga in 1967. In 1968, she worked as an assistant to Shigeru Mizuki , but quit after about a month. She got married in 1972 and moved to Kyoto. However, from the following year, she became ill and was found to be suffering from the incurable disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). ",
