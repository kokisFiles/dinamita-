It consists of leader [Nanase Ohkawa](https://anilist.co/staff/97292), and three artists who shift roles for each series: [Mokona](https://anilist.co/staff/100802) (もこな), [Tsubaki Nekoi](https://anilist.co/staff/100804), and Satsuki Igarashi (いがらし寒月). Almost 100 million CLAMP tankōbon copies have been sold worldwide as of October 2007.\n\nIn general, Ohkawa gets her inspiration for the group from everyday events such as dreams or the news. Unlike most manga artists who specialize in a single genre, CLAMP has created a diverse body of work. CLAMP's genres vary widely, from childish and comedic (<i>Cardcaptor Sakura, Clamp School Detectives</i>) to more dramatic and teen-rated (<i>xxxHolic, X</i>) series. Furthermore, drawing from the idea of Osamu Tezuka's <i>Star System</i> as they did in <i>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle</i>, CLAMP often crossover characters from their own series into their other works, which gives rise to a loosely defined \"Clamp Universe\".",

Her father was a big fan of classical and opera music and always desired for Yuki to play the piano for him. Yuki eventually gained a love for music and a love for the piano. Yuki started out as an SE programmer, but changed to music in 1992. She made her grand debut with a female trio called \"[See-Saw](https://anilist.co/staff/104342).\"  In the years to come the group released six singles and two albums. \n\nYuki then went on to work on her solo career composing for artists and some TV, films, and games, such as _Blood: The Last Vampire_ in 2001, and _Xenosaga II_ and _III_. In 2001, Yuki's claim to fame came with the release of the anime [_NOIR_](https://anilist.co/anime/272). The soundtrack sold 50,000 copies. In 2002, she was brought on to project .hack to write the score to [_.hack//SIGN_](https://anilist.co/anime/48), along with vocalist [Chiaki Ishikawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101059) and New York singer [Emily Bindiger](https://anilist.co/staff/103845).

In 2003, she formed the project [FictionJunction](https://anilist.co/staff/103691) in which pairs Yuki's songwriting and composition with different performing vocalists, first as separate solo works and later into a singular group.
