She was bullied relentlessly from elementary school until high school, eventually culminating in a suicide attempt. These experiences were later used for scenes in <i>Arata: The Legend</i>. She credits her recovery to religion, as she is a member of Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist organization that promotes peace centered on respect for the dignity of life, and she often provide illustrations for the organization's newsletter.\n\nIn 1998, Watase won the 43rd (1997) Shogakukan Manga Award for <i>Ayashi no Ceres</i>.",
