Mizuki Usami is the only person in the club who wants to do art club-like activities, and constantly struggles to do so.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

She was also the winner of the \"Best Musical Performance\" award in the first Seiyuu Awards. She was also part of the quartet Prits alongside Yumiko Kobayashi, Natsuko Kuwatani, and Hisayo Mochizuki (all four voiced characters in the anime _Sister Princess_). Her singing style comes from singing Enka since she was young.\n\nIn July 2020, she married someone from the music industry, and they had their first child on March 16, 2021.\n\n__Non-Anime Roles:__\n- Ittasha in Bakuage Sentai Boonboomger",

However, it was the anime series _Fullmetal Alchemist_ that was the first to inspire her to become a voice actress. At the time, she was impressed that the series' protagonist Edward Elric was voiced by a female actress, [Romi Park](https://anilist.co/staff/95082/Romi-Park).\n\nIn junior high school and high school, she became part of a chorus club to help her overcome her tone deafness.

She graduated in March 2014 and left Art Vision shortly after on April 1. On May 1, 2014, she transferred to the agency Intention and is currently affiliated with them today.\n\n__Music Career__\nHer music career began when she released songs for _The World God Only Knows_ under her character name Kanon Nakagawa. In 2013, she became part of the music group Rhodanthe*, which performed theme songs for the _Kiniro Mosaic_ series. After having been cast in 2015, she has also released singles as her Idolmaster character Mizuki Kawashima. In 2016, she voiced a member of the in-universe music group Walküre, which performed songs for the anime series _Macross Δ_.\n\nIn 2017, she made her solo debut as a singer on February 1 with the release of her single \"True Destiny\" / \"Chain the World\" under the Flying Dog label.
