  "description": "All things have a name by which they are defined. Amongst the named are the many long-forgotten gods that dwell within the world brought about by the prayers, fears and desires of humanity. In the famine stricken and riot plagued city of Edo, alarming events are visited upon the populace by these otherworldly beasts. Descending from the mountain tops or rising from the earth are these old gods, the Youi.<br>\n<br>\nFor nearly twenty-five years Yukiatsu Ryuudou has wandered the country-sides of Japan posing as a bodyguard, living the life of a gambler and thief, all the while denying his name. Through a chance encounter with a Youi and the members of the Office of Barbarian Knowledge Enforcement, Yukiatsu is forced to face the life he's been running from and rediscover his long hidden power of Ayagami, the ability to find true names and use them as a weapon to exorcise these beasts plaguing the material world.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Bandai Entertainment)",

The band got their name from the album Pornograffitti by the band Extreme. They currently record under the Sony Music Entertainment Japan Records (SME Records) label.  Haruichi Shindō originally formed the band with his cousin during high school and named it \"No Score.\" After the band started, Haruichi asked Akihito Okano and Masami \"Tama\" Shiratama to join. The band was so named because none of them could actually read a score when they first started. When they first started the band, Haruichi was the vocalist, but found out that Akihito could sing better, so he gave the vocalist position to Akihito and took over as guitarist instead. This was the foundation of Porno Graffitti.  They debuted with the song Apollo in 1999. Their two subsequent CD singles, Saudade and Agehachō, both sold over a million copies in Japan. They are also well known for the song Melissa, which was used as the opening theme of the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist in 2003. They also created the song Hitori no Yoru, used as the opening theme of the anime series GTO in 2000, and Winding Road, used as the ending theme of the anime series Ayakashi Ayashi in 2006. A cover of their 2000 single Music Hour was featured in a stage of the Nintendo DS rhythm game Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2. Their song Koyoi, Tsuki ga, Miezu Tomo was featured in the third Bleach film.",
