The girls make full use of the last days of summer, roaming around a heat-weary town and visiting various places including a shopping center and shooting stall. When they prowl around her basement, Mei expresses uneasiness about her new class, which is said to be cursed.<br>\n<br>\nCraving more entertainment, the twins decide to pay a visit to the local amusement park. But the leisure of a sleepy summer day could soon turn woeful as Mei sees the color of death on her sister—an unmistakable omen that a tragedy is bound to strike.\n",

However, the sound has changed in recent times to take on a darker and more mysterious tone. Takarano Arika, lead singer/lyricist, has termed this change as a transition from White Alice (白アリ) to Black Alice (黒アリ). Though there has been a general shift towards performing songs in the \"Black Alice\" phase, Ali Project has occasionally sung in the White Alice style as well.\n \nIn 1988 they made their indie debut in the chartsas Ari (Ant) Project (蟻プロジェクト) with their album Fantastic Garden (幻想庭園 Gensou Teien). The album was later included in Tatsumi Takayuki's book Philosophy of Progressive Rock (プログレッシヴ・ロックの哲学), which led to the band being classified under the progressive rock genre. Four years later in 1992 they changed their name and made their major debut with their single \"Fall in love, maiden\" (恋せよ乙女 Koi-seyo otome).\n\nMost of their records are released by Toshiba-EMI, Victor Entertainment and Tokuma Japan. The band is notable in the anime community for having their songs featured in several anime opening and ending sequences, most notably the series Noir and Rozen Maiden.\n\n<b>Members</b>\n- [Arika Takarano](https://anilist.co/staff/101307/Arika-Takarano) (宝野アリカ) - vocals, lyrics\n- [Mikiya Katakura](https://anilist.co/staff/101309/Mikiya-Katakura) (片倉三起也) - music, arrangement\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
