  "description": "It is Tokyo, 1969. Earth is under the attack of the \"Invaders.\" Fortunately, though, the public is unaware of this. But to the secret orginazation, A.E.G.I.S., the threat is very real, and it is up them to stop this invasion. One day on his route to high school, Ukiya Shun observes a battle between a young girl and a group of Invaders. He ends up helping her and discovers that much like the girl, he possesses the ability to generate a \"gate\" of special power that only a few other people are gifted with. As a result, Ukiya then joins A.E.G.I.S. in an effort to recruit other Gate Keepers in order to protect the city, all while doing his best not to imitate his late father, whom he dispises.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "__[Website](http://goto.cute.or.jp)__\n\nGotou began his career as an animator at Atorie. After the closing of Atorie, he worked for other studios such as Project Team Muu and Fenx before going freelancer. He serves as character designer, animation director and animator on countless anime series and contributes to a monthly comic strip to Newtype magazine.\n\nHe has been an animator since he graduated from high school at 18. Unlike most other animators Gotou had never gone to an art school. He became interested in animation after seeing an advertisement in an animation magazine saying that animators were needed. Without having any connections within the industry he went on and joined Atelier Giga and studied there for a year under [Akihiko Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/103299/) before marking his debut as animator on [Mister Ajikko](https://anilist.co/anime/3437/).\n\nIn 1988 Studio Atelier declared bancrupcy and he went to Project Team Muu, which later became Phoenix Entertainment. His first work there was as animator on Anime Sanjushi. When working on the Yuusha Saga, he met Ishida Atsuko on Densetsu no Yuusha Da Garn, who influenced Gotou in his character design, particularly the design of the eyes. Together with the experience from training under Yamashita Akihiko this influence resulted in Gotou's so called \"gocky picture\" later.\n\nHe made his debut as character designer on Choujin Densetsu Urotsukidouji 4 and his debut as series director on Kiddy Grade.\n\nMarried to [Megumi Kadonosono](https://anilist.co/staff/100963/).\n\n(Source: Anidb)",

He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work. Another of his most important work is often said to be [Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar](https://anilist.co/anime/890/), and the [sequel](https://anilist.co/anime/1382/) following it.\n\nIn 2002, he won the first Tokyo Anime Award for Best Music for his work on [Overman King Gainer](https://anilist.co/anime/1792/).",

He was an animation producer and president and representative director of Encourage Films.\n\nIkeda was influenced by Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon and decided to go into animation. After majoring from college he joined the Yoyogi Animation Gakuin.

After Digimation merged with Gonzo he continued to work for Gonzo Digimation and subsequently after the renaming back to its old name for Gonzo.\n\nHe was a producer at Gonzo, until he left in 2007 to become independent. He later established animation production company Encourage Films with the aim to produce happy animation for and together with fans, without any restrictions and boundaries, which was also the reason for the company's name. The establishment of the company together with animation supervisor and character designer Oizaki Fumitoshi was announced at the Phoenix Birth Event, related to Kaleido Star: Legend of Phoenix - Layla Hamilton Monogatari, by Loft Plus on August 10, 2008 in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.\n\nHe married on May 13, 2007. The wedding reception was done by voice actress Oohara Sayaka who had previously done the voice of Layla Hamilton in Kaleido Star, a series he produced for Gonzo.",

In 1984, he served as an assistant animation director on [Macross: Do You Remember Love?](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/). During the film's production, he met [Hideaki Anno](https://anilist.co/staff/100111/), who had just moved to Tokyo. Masuo and Anno quickly became friends and established Studio Graviton together with their fellow colleagues [Katsuhiko Nishijima](https://anilist.co/staff/103059/) and [Kouji Itou](https://anilist.co/staff/101166/). At Graviton, Masuo came to the limelight as the mechanical animation director on [Project A-Ko](https://anilist.co/anime/212/).\n\nAfter Graviton, he moved to [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/), where he worked as an assistant director for [Royal Space Force](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/), and as a unit director on [Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/).
