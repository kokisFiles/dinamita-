  "description": "Compilation film of the three <i>Kizumonogatari</i> movies.<br><br>\n\nSpring break, an interval of time between the second and third year of high school. It was one fateful evening when Koyomi Araragi encounters her.<br><br>\n\nKiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade.<br>\nLegendary Vampire. Killer of Apparitions. King of Apparitions.<br><br>\n\nHer legs and arms were cruelly torn apart, her extravagant dress soaked in red; she's a monster who finds herself in a tragic state, laying in a pool of her own blood. However, Koyomi finds her to be beautiful this way. <br><br>\n\nOn the brink of death after losing her four limbs, she asks Koyomi to save her. After experiencing fear, chaos, and finally conflict, Koyomi gives his own blood in order to save her.\nBut when he awakens, he finds himself re-born as her vampire kin.<br><br>\n\nKoyomi wishes to revert to being a human from a vampire. However, he must take back all of Kiss-shot's limbs to do so. Working as a negotiator, Meme Oshino stands in middle ground as Koyomi attempts to recapture her four limbs by challenging three powerful vampire hunters.<br><br>\n\nThis hellish spring break, the final one of his high school life, is only just beginning.<br><br>\n\n(Source: KIZUMONOGATARI -Koyomi Vamp- Official USA Website, edited)",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/新房昭之) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Shinbo)\n\nAkiyuki Shinbou is a Japanese director, producer, animator and storyboard artist. He joined Studio One Pattern in 1981. He made his directorial debut with [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/) in 1994. He joined Shaft in 2004. He has received the 11th Tokyo Anime Award and the 2011 Newtype Anime Award for Best director for his work on the acclaimed anime series [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/).\n\nShinbou was born in Fukushima Prefecture. After high school, he attended Tokyo Designer Institute before entering the anime industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo Design Institute, Shinbou worked as an animator for the 1981 anime series [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/). Shinbou participated with Studio Pierrot in 1990 as an episode director in [Musashi](https://anilist.co/anime/8065/). His first full directorial debut was however the previously mentioned, with Metal Fighter Miku. He continued his early directional career with several OVA series in the late 90's. Shinbou participated with Seven Arcs starting with [Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever](https://anilist.co/anime/176/) in 2003 and then became director for 2004's spin-off [Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha](https://anilist.co/anime/76/).\n\nHis style in particular became noticed during his episode direction work on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/)'s Dark Tournament arc. After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies. In an interview, Kubota cited [Le Portrait de Petit Cossette](https://anilist.co/anime/514/) and [The SoulTaker](https://anilist.co/anime/1048/) among Shinbou's most distinctive products that caught his eye.\n\nHis work at Shaft has been characterized by extensive experimentation within the visual medium of animation, and often includes pictures taken from real life cut into scenes, as well as art shifts, beat panels, kabuki sound effects, textures that remain stationary when the textured object moves, showing symbols or defining parts of a character in place of characters during dialogue, written text in place (in opposition to dialogue), precise use of fan service, and \"head-tilting\", a style known as a Shaft specialty.\n\nHe says that the reason he sticks with Shaft is due to their system and professional capacity, which make his expression of direction much easier. The so-called \"Team Shinbou\" includes himself, [Tatsuya Oishi](https://anilist.co/staff/103552/) and [Shin Oonuma](https://anilist.co/staff/101753/).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ohkowai/status/1446500402275373056)\n\nTakumi Yokota is an animator and character designer that is currently freelance. He was formerly affiliated with ufotable, Anime International Company (AIC), and Shaft.\n\nAfter graduating from university from the Faculty of Law department, he joined ufotable as a production assistant. He stated in an interview with Akiba Souken in 2019, that while watching movies and anime at the library in his third or fourth year of job hunting, he fell in love with the work Patlabor: The Mobile Police, directed by Mamoru Oshii. And while watching Oshii's interview, he decided that he wanted to become a director, and when he was researching on how to become a director, he found out that one of the paths of becoming a director is by starting out as a production assistant; and so he applied as a production assistant at ufotable. He later left ufotable due to various reasons and described himself as a NEET for almost half a year after departing from ufotable. After more than three months of being a NEET, he thought to himself that he really needed to get a job, and then remembered his time as a production assistant at ufotable. While still working as a production assistant at ufotable, a conversation with an animator at ufotable stuck with him, and thought subsequently: \"Let's go back to anime again!\" And in 2007, he applied as an animator at Anime International Company (AIC) when he saw that the studio was hiring 20 new animators, and got the position. He made his debut as an animator with 2007's Tokyo Majin, co-animated by AIC Spirits and BeSTACK. He has stated that while at his time at the studio, AIC took care of its animators well so that they could live, and was occasionally treated by his seniors at the studio. He cites Ryuichi Makino as one of his mentors while at AIC. In 2011, he made his debut as an animation director in 2011, with AIC's adaptation of R-15 of the same name. In 2013, he made his character designer debut with Pupipo!, animated by AIC PLUS+. In 2014, he left AIC and became an animator at Shaft. As of December 2019, he has become freelance.",

Many of his cuts have the Ohira wobble. Abe has said he enjoys doing background animation and integrates it into many of his scenes.",
