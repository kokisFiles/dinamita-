Much of Earth is laid in ruins, Nerv has been dismantled, and people who he once protected have turned against him. Befriending the enigmatic Nagisa Kaworu, Shinji continues the fight against the angels and realizes the fighting is far from over, even when it could be against his former allies.

          "description": "[Twitter (shiimai)](https://twitter.com/shiimai) | [Sakugabooru](https://www.sakugabooru.com/post?tags=hiroyuki_imaishi+) \n\nHiroyuki Imaishi was born in 1971, in Tokyo. He joined studio Gainax after graduating from Tama University of Arts. Imaishi later left the studio to establish his own studio, Trigger, where he still works to this day.\n\nImaishi made a name for himself on *Hideaki Anno*'s [Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou](https://anilist.co/anime/145/Kareshi-Kanojo-no-Jijou/). He did key animation and storyboards for several episodes, with episode 19 being a standout for its unorthodox paper cutout animation. His presence injected some stylized levity into Anno's shoujo drama.\n\nImaishi started as an animator heavily influenced by [Masahito Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/138566/Masahito-Yamashita) and [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada). He draws \nwith a similar warping of perspective and with characters snapping into discrete poses, mixed with cartoony devices reminiscent of A Pro's work on [Dokonjo Gaeru](https://anilist.co/anime/5618/Dokonjou-Gaeru/), of which Imaishi is a fan. He also tends to draw his characters enveloped in speedlines, with strongly defined eyes and eyebrows, rectangular jawlines, and gummy, gritted teeth. His cuts are willfully limited, eliminating transitions between poses and using fast looping for comedic effect.\n\nImaishi became one of Gainax' premier directors after Kare Kano. His directorial aesthetic is heavily informed by his animation. Elisions of graphic space become elisions of cinematic space and time.The interplay of moving and still planes, forceful use of text, and extreme variations in size are other major components of his direction. His shot compositions are usually very busy due to crunching in as much of his characters into the frame as possible, and he has no problem reducing action scenes to pure visual abstraction, like rendering clashing figures as a few pencil lines. He is known to employ [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki)-esque tricks like triple takes and postcard shots in his work. His storyboards are rough, improvised, and lacking in detail. He's a fan of American director [Robert Rodriguez](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/) and [John Woo](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000247/), and loves referencing classic anime and film in his works.\n\nHis first solo directorial effort was the Production I.G. OVA [Dead Leaves](https://anilist.co/anime/974/Dead-Leaves/) which would set the stage for Imaishi's later works: crude, anarchic, and heterogeneous characters positioned against a homogenizing totalitarian force. Dead Leaves uses pillarboxing and text in a manner recalling stylized comic books. Imaishi served as character designer and animation director on the OVA so the animation is steeped in his neo-Kamada idiom more than any of his other works.\n\nImaishi left Gainax and formed studio Trigger with [Masahiko Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/108023/Masahiko-Ootsuka) in 2011, bringing over several major animators to the new studio. His debut TV work with Trigger was 2013's [Kill la Kill](https://anilist.co/anime/18679/Kill-la-Kill/), that similarly to Gurren Lagann, freely and extensively referenced anime history. Despite being a broadly popular series overseas, it is Imaishi's most controversial work to date, not only for its extreme levels of fanservice, but also because it suffered damaging production problems: rewrites of the script, cost cutting animation shortcuts, and a restrictive schedule. \n\n[Source](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/hiroyuki-imaishi/)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/y_sadamoto)\n\nYoshiyuki Sadamoto is an animator, illustrator, character designer, and one of the founding members of studio Gainax.\n\nAfter college, Sadamoto learned the ropes of key animation under [Yasuo Otsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/Yasuo--Otsuka) at Telecom before becoming a founding member of Gainax. Otsuka later named Sadamoto one of the three men more skillful than him. Though Sadamoto is not an unskilled animator by any means, his reputation rests mainly on his iconic character designs, evident in the reception of the Evangelion cast. Nearly all of Gainax' biggest productions have their characters designed by Sadamoto. He is one of the biggest contributors to the general look of Gainax anime and has proven to be massively influential for character designers of future generations.\n\nSadamoto's characters are often thin, fragile and have sharp yet understated facial features. He pays a lot of attention to fashion as well.\n\nMost of Sadamoto's influences are mangaka such as [Katsuhiro Otomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Otomo), [Yoshitaka Amano](https://anilist.co/staff/97967/Yoshitaka-Amano), [Kazuo Umezu](https://anilist.co/staff/97777/Kazuo-Umezu), and [Leiji Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/97597/Leiji-Matsumoto). Sadamoto would go on to author the Evangelion manga. \n\nPost-Gainax he has remained active as character designer, mostly for [Mamoru Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/Mamoru-Hosoda)'s popular feature films. He has also focused on different visual and illustration works, as he worked on several manga and is co-creator and character designer for the .hack game franchise.",

Eventually, a recording contract with Toshiba-EMI was signed and, under the stage name Cubic U, Utada released their English-language debut album Precious in early 1998, but it was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, their Japanese-language debut First Love was released and became an instant success. Backed by the massive success of singles \"Automatic,\" \"Time Will Tell,\" and \"Movin' On Without You,\" the album sold two million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the Oricon charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six million more throughout the rest of 1999. First Love eventually became the country's best-selling album of all time.\n\nBy the end of the '00s, Utada was deemed \"the most influential artist of the decade\" in the Japanese music landscape by The Japan Times. Utada's commercial success has made them one of Japan's top-selling recording artists of all time with over 37 million records sold since launching their career in the late '90s. Twelve of their singles have reached number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart, while ten of their albums have become chart-toppers. Six of their full-length releases are among the country's highest-selling albums of all time, including First Love, Distance and Deep River, which are among the top ten best-selling records of Japan's music history.\n\nUtada has performed theme songs for all of the four [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/2759/) reboot movies, as well as for [Freedom](https://anilist.co/anime/1747/) and [To Your Eternity](https://anilist.co/anime/114535/).\n\nAdditionally, they are also known by international audiences for writing and producing four theme-songs to the video game series Kingdom Hearts.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The series was praised by Western critics and received multiple international accolades.\n\nCalled one of the most imaginative visualists in anime by Helen McCarthy, a British anime reference book author.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nKnown to have been a close friend of [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s before his passing.",

His works span the transition from the classical period to the romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his \"middle\" period showed an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as \"heroic.\" During this time, he began to suffer increasingly from deafness. In his \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
