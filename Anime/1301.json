  "description": "After the death of his mother at the hands of the evil robot Count Mecha, young Tetsuro has become a delinquent street urchin who dreams only of revenge. <br>\nTetsuro lives in a far future world in which humans have the choice to travel to another planet where they can exchange their bodies for immortal, robotic counterparts. His goal is to someday acquire (through theft) enough money to board the Galaxy Express 999, a train which is capable of traveling through space, and which will take him to the planet of robots. <br><br>\nOne day, after escaping from the police, he meets the beautiful Maetel, who resembles his mother. She offers to take him on the Galaxy Express 999 to get a robotic body and to get revenge on Count Mecha. Along the journey, the two meet many varied people (including Captain Harlock and Queen Emeraldas), and Tetsuro learns what it means to be human.<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/leijimatsumoto)\n\nMatsumoto's art might take some getting used to, but he is renowned for coming up with great stories and brilliant new concepts. Debuting in 1953 with a 16 page manga \"Mitsubachi no Bouken\" in Manga Shounen, he has authored nearly thirty manga series.\n\nHis big break came in 1971, in the years between 53 and 71 he mostly produced Shoujo manga, much to his displeasure. In the late '70s and the early '80s, there was a big Matsumoto-boom when he drew his best known series. After that, things became more quiet around him, but the late '90s show a revival.\n\nThe trademarks of Matsumoto are his unusual artstyle, the space opera and the manly romance stories.\n\nIn 1997, Matsumoto began to create new adventures of Captain Harlock which can be admired on the Web in Japanese and in English.\n\nOne of Matsumoto Reiji's former assistants is [Sennou Knife](https://anilist.co/staff/99382), who was also an assistant of [Maki Miyako](https://anilist.co/staff/114821/). He went solo in the mid-80s and enjoyed modest success with Yami no Silhouette.\n\nHis real name is Matsumoto Akira. Reiji is a pseudonym and means something like \"Zero Warrior\". His name is often rendered in romaji as \"Matsumoto Leiji\". Matsumoto is married to Maki Miyako.\n\nHe died of heart failure on February 13, 2023 in a hospital in Tokyo.",

          "description": "Shigeyuki Hayashi, better known by his pseudonym Rintarou, is a well-known anime director.\n\nA film buff ever since he was a kid, he wanted to pursue a career in filmmaking. After having worked as a cel painter in commercial animation, he joined [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/) in 1958 for a brief time working on films such as [Hakujaden](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and [Saiyuuki](https://anilist.co/anime/4481/). After having been told that he couldn't work as a director due to not being a college graduate, he moved to [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) - making his directorial debut as one of the regular episode directors on [Tetsuwan Atom](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/).\n\nIn 1972, Rintarou left Mushi Pro to go freelance and to co-found [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11) together with [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/). A few years later, Rintarou got invited to direct [Jetter Mars](https://anilist.co/anime/6087/) at his previously disinterested workplace, Toei Animation. He accepted the offer but didn't join the studio as an employee, making him one of the few people who've directed for the studio while not being an inhouse employee. He continued to direct multiple entries for Toei, including [Arrow Emblem](https://anilist.co/anime/3800/), [Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/), as well as the 1979 film [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1301/), which is still considered by many as his best work.\n\n[Haruki Kadokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170354/), the president of [Kadokawa Shoten](https://anilist.co/studio/113/), took notice of the commercial success of Rintarou's works and hired him to direct [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/), which was the very first film produced by Kadokawa. The animation production was handled by Madhouse, where Rintarou changed his post at this time. There he continued his directorial efforts with numerous films and OVA series.\n\nThe older brother of [Masayuki Hayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/161046/).",

          "description": "A highly prolific and an extremely influential animator.\n\nKnow for his experimentation with the timing of keyframes, his dynamic poses, and his peculiar effects Kanada pioneered a number of techniques and concepts that permeated and shaped the Japanese animation industry, influencing not only his peers but also the generations to come.\n\nKanada's ability and his tendency to be very personal with his drawings, even to the point of ignoring storyboards if the situation required, popularized in the industry the concept of letting the individual animator's talents shine instead of being uniformed into anonymity. This precept is still respected today and it's one of the reasons Japanese animation is so distinctly unique. His career is also a testament to his ethos that expressive and vibrant animation is not achieved simply through increasing the number of frames but through playing with movement, poses and timing.\n\nIn the early '00s, Kanada became an employee at Square Enix.\n\nNotable Square Enix titles in which he was credited:\n\n~!\n- 2002, Final Fantasy XI (Motion Capture, Animation Director)\n- 2005, Musashiden II: Blade Master (Storyboard)\n- 2006, Dawn of Mana (Facial Setting)\n- 2007, Final Fantasy 4 DS Version (Storyboard)\n- 2009, Final Fantasy XIII (Storyboard Director) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2011, Final Fantasy XIII-2 (Storyboard) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2012, Dragon Quest X (Storyboard)  - *Posthumous credit.* !~",

          "description": "Takamura Mukuo was a famous art director from Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan. He was a graduate of Musashino Art University, where he majored in Western Painting. After graduating in 1963, Mukuo joined Tokyo Movie Studio and started his career as a background artist for animation. In 1966, he established his own studio, Mukuo Group and Mukuo Studio in 1968, which was incorporated three years later in 1971.\n\nSome of his best known works include the feature film [Cello Hiki no Gauche](https://anilist.co/anime/1049/) and [Haha o Tazunete Sanzenri](https://anilist.co/anime/1663/), part of the WMT series, both directed by [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/). For the latter he visited actual places in Italy and Argentina together with Takahata and Miyazaki, to ensure an authentic feel to the series.\n\nHe was also known for his contribution to science-fiction anime franchises [Uchuu Senkan Yamato](https://anilist.co/anime/1650/), [Uchuu Kaizoku Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/) and [Ginga Tetsudou 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/).\n\nHe was awarded the first grand-prix of the first anime popularity contest in the category of art, which was organised by the publisher Tokuma-Shoten. The contest was won by Mukuo five times in a row, until it was cancelled, making him the only winner in the art category.\n\nMukuo had greatly contributed to the rapid development of the animation in Japan during the 1970s and 80s.\n\nHe passed away from cancer on June 9, 1992 at the age of 54. At that time he was working on the [Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/530/) series. [Tadao Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/154564/) took over his place but Mukuo was still credited as art designer of the Sailor Moon series subsequently for all later works.\n\nTadao Kubota, who was a manager at the Mukuo Studio, took also over Mukuo's duties as representative director of the studio.\n\nIn April 2004 a book that collected all of his best works was released posthumously. Titled Takamura Mukuo: The Art of Animation and supervised by Keiko Mukuo and Tadao Kubota, it does include much of Mukuo's background art, image boards, and plans to masterpieces like Ginga Tetsudou 999, Haha o Tazunete Sanzenri, [Neo Tokyo](https://anilist.co/anime/1951/), Cello Hiki no Gauche, Sailor Moon and [Kamui no Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/496/).",

He began his career in television animation in the 1960s and started producing his own independent animation in 1965.  His aesthetic is distinctive for his use of flowing lines, highly complex drawings, and his love of psychedelic colours.  He was a prolific artist who often produced several animated shorts a year either on his own or in collaboration with his friend and fellow artist the Keiichi Tanaami. Nobuhiro died on April the 30, 2011 and left behind 85 animated works.",
