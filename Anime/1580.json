After graduating from high school, he joined Studio Musashi, which was recruiting staff through newspaper ads. His first work as an official in-betweener was for [Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace](https://anilist.co/anime/1986/). He then moved to Studio Cockpit, where he worked on [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1491/), before moving on to NeoMedia. There he worked on [Trider G7](https://anilist.co/anime/4536/), [Doraemon](https://anilist.co/anime/2471/), and [Belle and Sebastian](https://anilist.co/anime/3836/). With Trider G7, he was promoted from in-between to key animation. He left NeoMedia in 1982 to work as a freelancer, starting with [Combat Mecha Xabungle](https://anilist.co/anime/2254/) and [Makyou Densetsu Acrobunch](https://anilist.co/anime/3880/).\n\nThe popular anime [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/), in which he participated from the same year, was Moriyama's breakthrough work.

Chief director [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/), who was responsible for Urusei Yatsura, expected him to become a partner, so Moriyama tried his hand at manga as well by illustrating a manga written by Oshii that was serialized in the Animage magazine in 1984 called Todo no Tsumari. After the end of Urusei Yatsura, he was selected as a character designer for the later series [Maison Ikkoku](https://anilist.co/anime/1453/), and has since been in charge of character design for many other works. In 1987, he won the 4th Japan Anime Awards in the Animation Director category. After that, he shifted from animating to directing.\nAfter that he participated in many works, mainly Chaos Project , Studio Pierrot , and Studio Hibari and then has seated at Studio Hibari's Lerche. \n\nMoriyama often works under one of his many pen-names.\n\n",
