It doesn't work, but one of the girls—Tuan Kirie—grows up to be a member of the World Health Organization. As a crisis threatens the harmony of the new world, Tuan rediscovers another member of her suicide pact, and together they must help save the planet...from itself.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Viz Media)",

          "description": "Itou Keikaku (伊藤計劃), also known as Project Itoh, real name Itou Satoshi (伊藤聡, October 14, 1974 – March 20, 2009), was a Japanese science fiction writer and essayist.\n\nBorn in Tokyo and graduated from the Department of Imaging Arts and Sciences at Musashino Art University. While working as a web designer, he wrote Genocidal Organ and submitted to Komatsu Sakyou Award contest in 2006. Although it did not receive the award, it was published from Hayakawa Publishing in 2007 and was nominated to Nihon SF Taisho Award.\n\nSince 2001, he had to be hospitalized frequently for recurrent cancer. He died at age 34 on March 20, 2009. The video game Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and the last chapter of the manga Aki Sora were dedicated to his memory.\n\nA poll by the yearly SF guidebook SF ga yomitai ranked Genocidal Organ as the number one of the domestic SF novel of the decade. Hayakawa's S-F Magazine All-Time Best poll in 2014 ranked Harmony as the top of the Japanese SF novels.\n\nToh Enjoe's Self-Reference ENGINE was also a finalist of Komatsu Sakyou Award and published from Hayakawa Shobou in 2007, along with Itou's Genocidal Organ. Since then they often appeared together at science fiction conventions and interviews, and collaborated in a few works, until Itou's death. At the press conference after the announcement of Enjoe's Akutagawa Prize in January 2012, Enjoe revealed the plan to complete Itou's unfinished novel Shisha no Teikoku. It was published in August 2012, and received the Special Award of Nihon SF Taisho Award.",

          "description": "Michael Arias, born 1968 in California, is an award-winning filmmaker, spanning the worlds of live-action storytelling, visual effects, computer graphics, and anime. He graduated from the Webb School of California at age 16 and attended Wesleyan University in Connecticut, before eventually dropping out to pursue a career in the film industry.\n\nArias got his start at Dream Quest Images, working as a camera assistant on the motion control stages of effect-heavy films such as The Abyss (1989) and Total Recall (1990). In 1990, Arias was asked by visual effects godfather Douglas Trumbull to program ride vehicle motion for [Back to the Future...The Ride](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101392/), which is considered a milestone in immersive entertainment. He then moved to Tokyo for stints at post-production behemoth Imagica and game giant Sega, until returning to the United States to co-found effects boutique Syzygy Digital Cinema.\n\nAt CG innovator Softimage, Arias developed and patented tools for combining traditional animation and computer graphics, working closely with Studio Ghibli to add a distinct visual flavor to Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. In 2000, Arias arranged Studio 4C to produce [The Animatrix](https://anilist.co/anime/1303/Animatrix/), which subsequently broke home-video record sales and won numerous awards. Arias had since become [Eiko Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/103607/Eiko-Tanaka)'s right hand man.\n\nIn the wake of his The Animatrix success, he was given the prestigious role of Chief Director of [Tekkon Kinkreet](https://anilist.co/anime/2154/Tekkon-Kinkreet) (2005), after [Kouji Morimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100066/Kouji-Morimoto) abandoned the project. With this, Arias became the first non-Japanese director of a major anime film, which attracted much attention during the initial screenings of the film.\n\nHis approach to the film was unorthodox; storyboarding duties were broken up on a scene-by-scene basis, with many of the film's major animators directing their own scenes. Another unique quality Arias brought to the production was the simulated handheld camera effects that suffuse the film, a creative decision he maintained despite protests from art director [Shinji Kimura](https://anilist.co/staff/100373/Shinji-Kimura). Arias' short for [Ani*Kuri15](https://anilist.co/anime/2832/AniKuri15/) also featured subtle rocking of the frame, erratic depth of field, and other handheld film artifices. \n\nArias is an active member of the Visual Effects Society, and has co-authored papers for and, at one time or another, served as guest editor, presenter, panelist, and juror for ACM/Siggraph. He is also a frequent writer on Japanese culture, animation, and manga.\n\nsources: [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0034712/) | [camonte](https://camonte.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/michael-arias/)",
