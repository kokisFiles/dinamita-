  "description": "Hitomi Tsukishiro may be the child of a family of witches, but after losing her ability to see color, she also lost her sense of magic. Nothing has been able to help her regain that gift — nothing until Hitomi’s grandmother, that is, sends Hitomi back in time to the year 2018! There Hitomi meets her grandmother’s younger self. She also discovers fascinating drawings of a young man named Yuito Aoi. The moment Hitomi lays eyes on his work, colors flood back into view. But why do his drawings have this effect on Hitomi, and for what purpose has her grandmother sent her so far back in time? As Hitomi’s feelings for Yuito grow, she finds herself poised on the cusp of personal transformation, color and magic returning as she blossoms into the young woman she’s meant to be.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
