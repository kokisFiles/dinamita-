He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work. Another of his most important work is often said to be [Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar](https://anilist.co/anime/890/), and the [sequel](https://anilist.co/anime/1382/) following it.\n\nIn 2002, he won the first Tokyo Anime Award for Best Music for his work on [Overman King Gainer](https://anilist.co/anime/1792/).",
