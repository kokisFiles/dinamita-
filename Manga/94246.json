  "description": "In the future, Utopia has finally been achieved thanks to medical nanotechnology and a powerful ethic of social welfare and mutual consideration. This perfect world isn't that perfect though, and three young girls stand up to totalitarian kindness and super-medicine by attempting suicide via starvation. It doesn't work, but one of the girls—Tuan Kirie—grows up to be a member of the World Health Organization. As a crisis threatens the harmony of the new world, Tuan rediscovers another member of her suicide pact, and together they must help save the planet...from itself.<br><br>\n(Source: VIZ Media)",

          "description": "Itou Keikaku (伊藤計劃), also known as Project Itoh, real name Itou Satoshi (伊藤聡, October 14, 1974 – March 20, 2009), was a Japanese science fiction writer and essayist.\n\nBorn in Tokyo and graduated from the Department of Imaging Arts and Sciences at Musashino Art University. While working as a web designer, he wrote Genocidal Organ and submitted to Komatsu Sakyou Award contest in 2006. Although it did not receive the award, it was published from Hayakawa Publishing in 2007 and was nominated to Nihon SF Taisho Award.\n\nSince 2001, he had to be hospitalized frequently for recurrent cancer. He died at age 34 on March 20, 2009. The video game Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and the last chapter of the manga Aki Sora were dedicated to his memory.\n\nA poll by the yearly SF guidebook SF ga yomitai ranked Genocidal Organ as the number one of the domestic SF novel of the decade. Hayakawa's S-F Magazine All-Time Best poll in 2014 ranked Harmony as the top of the Japanese SF novels.\n\nToh Enjoe's Self-Reference ENGINE was also a finalist of Komatsu Sakyou Award and published from Hayakawa Shobou in 2007, along with Itou's Genocidal Organ. Since then they often appeared together at science fiction conventions and interviews, and collaborated in a few works, until Itou's death. At the press conference after the announcement of Enjoe's Akutagawa Prize in January 2012, Enjoe revealed the plan to complete Itou's unfinished novel Shisha no Teikoku. It was published in August 2012, and received the Special Award of Nihon SF Taisho Award.",
