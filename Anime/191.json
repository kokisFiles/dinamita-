Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket (short for Comic Market, a comic convention bi-annually held in Japan). He used the pen name Awa Mizuno (水野亜和). Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His \"A Kid's Game for One Summer\" was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated.    \n\nAfter a big hit with A.I. Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga, Love Hina. The series appeared in Weekly Shonen Magazine and has been collected in eleven volumes (with fourteen volumes in total), which have sold over 6 million copies in Japan, and received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen in 2001.  Akamatsu had added elements of his own life experiences to the story, and this was said to have induced a unique feeling to the manga especially for Western readers, whose lack of familiarity with Japanese culture for the most part added to the effect. The series, published in America in 2002, was especially well received in many overseas countries - Akamatsu was surprised that even foreign readers found Love Hina to be \"cute\" and to their liking.    \n\nHe is now married to his wife 'Kanon' Akamatsu, who was previously a singer/idol.\n\nSince 2022, he has held a seat in the House of Councillors proportional representation block of the National Diet.",

Three years later in he met [Sushio](https://anilist.co/staff/103619/) at Comiket, which led to Kubota joining [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/). There he made his debut as an animation director on the premiere of [Mahoromatic](https://anilist.co/anime/277/)'s second season.\n\nIn 2005, he made his debut as a character designer, although still jointly together with Sushio and [Takaaki Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/110187/), on the 6th [One Piece](https://anilist.co/anime/464/) movie. The film was directed by Mamoru Hosoda, which led to Kubota getting an invite to join the production of [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/) as an animation director. After this he kept working at Gainax until going freelance.\n\nIn 2012, he worked as the main character designer on [From the New World](https://anilist.co/anime/13125/) and [Robotics;Notes](https://anilist.co/anime/13599/), and a few years later he served as one on [One-Punch Man](https://anilist.co/anime/21087/), which earned him international fame.",

          "description": "As is the case with many Japanese artists, her privacy was well guarded; little is known about her life apart from her artistic career. \n\nDuring the 90s, she continued singing and also wrote for anime voice actors. From 2000, she became involved in earnest with anime and composed several songs for Wedding Peach, Fruits Basket and Love Hina. She formed the duo Melocure in 2002 with singer-songwriter Megumi Hinata, and in the following two years, the duo released several singles and an album, Melodic Hard Cure. Okazaki also produced songs during these years for artists such as Megumi Hayashibara, Mayumi Iizuka, and Yui Horie.  Her work consists mainly of ballads, and can be categorised within the spectrum of Japanese music as most closely related to J-Pop. According to her fans, the lyrics of Okazaki's songs are characterized by poetic imagery, depth of emotion, gentle optimism and simplicity.  \n\nOn May 5, 2004, Ritsuko Okazaki died suddenly at the age of 44 from septic shock as a result of septicemia. She was unable to speak any last words, and left her work unfinished. ",
