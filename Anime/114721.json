  "description": "Second part of <i>OBSOLETE</i>.<br><br>The year is 2021. In spite of the restrictions imposed by the Sankt Gallen Arrangement, which was spearheaded by the United States and other industrialized nations, the EXOFRAME, a consciousness-controlled general-use humanoid robot distributed by the alien \"Peddler\", has spread throughout the world. Bowman and his unit, who have been gathering intelligence about EXOFRAME in various parts of the world, find out that someone is planning to expand the use of EXOFRAME on the battlefield. All the evidence pointed to Raila Reshep, the President of the emerging African nation, Republic of Azania. He is working as the de facto leader of the new African Union while also being the mastermind behind the mysterious special operation unit the Outcast Brigade that promoted the technological independence of developing countries by expanding the use of the EXOFRAME, which is available to everyone in the world for close to nothing. However, the report made by Bowman and his unit are destroyed by their higher ups. Bowman and his unit move forward with Gavial, a secret Marine Corps EXOFRAME development project in Area 51 to counter Azania.<br><br>(Source: Official Site)",

In the game industry he is well-known for his work on the _Final Fantasy_ series and for his frequent collaboration with game designer Yasumi Matsuno, while in the anime industry he has had some involvement in doing character designs for certain shows.\n\nHe started working for Square Co. in 1995, before the company eventually merged with Enix and became Square Enix. He then left company Square Enix in September of 2013, and became a freelance creator. On October of 2014, he became the company director of CyDesignation, which is a subsidiary of Cygames.\n\n__Biography:__\nIn 1995, Akihiko joined then named Square Co, and with each project he took on, he experimented with different styles of graphic design. He has compared his use of color to that of character designer Tetsuya Nomura, who has worked on the game series Kingdom Hearts. In addition he is alike in the way that they similarily try to keep the color consistent between the characters and game world.\n\nFor the game Tactics Ogre, the pencil etchings and CG coloration were used together for the first time. Akihiko considers the tone and style of the game to be the \"ideal\" art style and is thus within his comfort zone. The original tarot card illustrattions for the game were done with dot graphics, and reflected a limited color index. When remade for the PlayStation Portable (PSP), some staff wanted to use the original illustrations, but Akihiko requested to redraw the illustrattions in more detail and color than was possible or required previously.\n\nWhen designing the character of Vaan for Final Fantasy XII, initially the character had the characteristics of a \"rugged\" and \"tough\" persona, but after considering the demographics of the games audience, the character was made younger and thinner. Once the actors motion captured and voice actor Kohei Takeda did his part, the character became slightly less effeminate than was originally designed. Akihiko set out to create a cast of characters who looked unlike any previous Final Fantasy cast. he also stated that the character reflected what Japanese audiences wanted, but that they did try to design characters everyone likes.\n\n(Source: [Wikipedia (Akihiko Yoshida)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihiko_Yoshida), edited)",

Growing up in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, he joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. \n\nAfter releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. He ceased production of the album, however, and began performing under the name Skrillex, distributing the My Name Is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page. Subsequently, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late–2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid–2011, both of which have since become moderate commercial successes. Skrillex has won eight Grammy Awards and holds the world record for most Grammys won by an Electronic Dance Music artist. Skrillex has collaborated with Diplo and Boys Noize to form the groups of Jack Ü and Dog Blood respectively. It was announced on Moore's 29th birthday, he reunited with From First To Last and released a single named \"Make War\". In 2017, Skrillex produced and mixed 8, the eighth studio album by rock band Incubus. In July 2017, Skrillex released another single featuring debuting solo artist Poo Bear. (Source: Wikipedia)",
