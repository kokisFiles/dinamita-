  "description": "The intrigue goes international in The King of Eden, a feature-length conspiracy thriller that continues the action of Eden of the East. The deadly game that began in Japan now intensifies on the streets of New York City. The rules are the same: do whatever it takes to win. Die if you lose.<br><br>\nTakizawa prevented Japan's destruction - and then he vanished. Six months later, clues lead Saki to the Big Apple in search of her missing friend. Meanwhile, the remaining Selecao are plotting their final move. Some of them would prefer Takizawa dead and out of the way. Some might even be willing to help him achieve his goals. Unfortunately, some are prepared to destroy everything if it means claiming checkmate in Mr. Outside's puzzling game.<br><br>\n(Source: Funimation Entertainment)",

However, he dropped out after half a year. With a few friends, he created the band Muse, playing fusion rock and participating in music competitions. Through competing in such contests, the band members became technically competent to enter the music industry and decided to part ways.\n\nAfter leaving Muse, Kawai Kenji began composing music for commercials in his home studio. While recording music for [Yuji Mitsuya](https://anilist.co/staff/95874/) he met music director Naoko Asari, who advised him to compose anime soundtracks. Some of his most famous anime soundtracks can be found in [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/1288/), [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), [Fate/Stay Night](https://anilist.co/anime/356/), [When They Cry](https://anilist.co/anime/934/) and more recently in [Mob Psycho 100](https://anilist.co/anime/21507/).\n\nHe has worked on several projects with the director [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) and has written scores for all of Hideo Nakata's films. Kenji Kawai's music has received the Annie award and Hong Kong Film Award in 2005, for [Ghost in The Shell 2: Innocence](https://anilist.co/anime/468/) he was nominated for an Annie award.\n\nFollowing his success as an anime music composer, he became involved in live action movies. He contributed music to horror films: Ring, Ring 2, Dark Water, Japanese-Polish science-fiction film Avalon and the Hong Kong film Seven Swords.\n\nFor the music found in Seven Swords and A Battle of Wits he was nominated for Best Original Film Score Awards at both the 25th and 26th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2006 and 2007.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

          "description": "<b>Introduction:</b>\nSchool Food Punishment was a Japanese four-piece rock/pop/electronica band. They were first signed under record label July Records/United Asia Entertainment (2007-2007), then under Fiveman Army Rocks (2008-2009) and then finally signed under Sony Music Japan's Epic Records Japan prior to their breakup in June 2012. The lyrics of each of the band's songs from 2004-2012 were written by lead vocalist and guitarist Yumi Uchimura.\n\n<b>Biography:</b>\nThe band was founded on October 2004 by [Uchimura Yumi](https://anilist.co/staff/152896/), while their first live performance took place in December the same year. In 2007, their debut album, \"<i>school food is good food</i>\", was released. In 2008, both of their songs, \"feedback\" and \"Futari Umi no Soko\" were featured as theme songs to the Japanese television drama <i>Joshidaisei Kaikeishi no Jikenbo</i>, while their mini-album \"<i>Riff-rain</i>\" was released by Tower Records and sold out in under a week. They also performed in numerous live concerts, including FM802, part of the Minami Wheel 2008 live event, and the J-Wave Live event, part of the Tokyo Real Eyes Live Supernova.\n\nIn 2009, they signed onto their first major record label, Sony Music Japan's Epic Records Japan division. Their major label debut was the song \"<a href=\"https://anidb.net/song/4695\">futuristic imagination</a>\", which was used as the ending theme song to the <a href=\"https://anilist.co/staff/100348/Kenji-Kamiyama\">Kenji Kamiyama</a> directed anime television series <i><a href=\"https://anilist.co/anime/5630/Higashi-no-Eden/\">Eden of the East</a></i>, airing on the highly rated noitaminA timeslot on Fuji TV.

The band said the decision came as a result of discussions between the four members.\n\nOn June 11, 2012 the band announced that they had broken up due to vocalist [Uchimura Yumi](https://anilist.co/staff/152896/) having left the band.\n\nFollowing the disbandment of the band School Food Punishment, [Uchimura Yumi](https://anilist.co/staff/152896/), producer [Eguchi Ryo](https://anilist.co/staff/109383/) and touring guitarist Mitsui Ritsuo joined the band <a href=\"https://anilist.co/staff/151900/la-la-larks\">la la larks</a> known as the successor to the band School Food Punishment. In 2016, Hasuo Masayuki and Yamasaki Hideaki found a new singer named <a href=\"https://anilist.co/staff/105228/Annabel\">Annabel</a>, and formed their own band siraph, as well.\n\n<b>Final Members:</b>\n- [Uchimura Yumi](https://anilist.co/staff/152896/) (内村友美) – founder, lead-vocalist, guiarist and songwriter (2004-2012)\n- Hasuo Masayuki (蓮尾理之) – keyboardist, organist, electric pianoist and composer (2004-2012)\n- Hideaki Yamasaki (山崎英明) – bass guitarist, backing vocalist and composer (2008-2012)\n- Hidai Osamu (比田井修) – drummer and composer (2007-2012)\n\n<b>Former Members:</b>\n- Ueda Atsushi (上田睦) – bass guitarist (2004-2008)\n- Katano Katsuya (片野勝哉) – drummer (2004-2007)\n\n(Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Food_Punishment\">en.wikipedia.org</a>)",

They were first signed under record label July Records/United Asia Entertainment (2007-2007), then under Fiveman Army Rocks (2008-2009) and then finally signed under Sony Music Japan's Epic Records Japan prior to their breakup in June 2012. The lyrics of each of the band's songs from 2004-2012 were written by lead vocalist and guitarist Yumi Uchimura.\n\n<b>Biography:</b>\nThe band was founded on October 2004 by [Uchimura Yumi](https://anilist.co/staff/152896/), while their first live performance took place in December the same year.
