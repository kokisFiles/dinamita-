          "description": "Shouji Kawamori is an anime creator, director and mechanical designer. Also a current advisor for [Satelight](https://anilist.co/studio/41/).\n\nFamous for his work in the [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) and Transformers franchises. He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",

However, he dropped out after half a year. With a few friends, he created the band Muse, playing fusion rock and participating in music competitions. Through competing in such contests, the band members became technically competent to enter the music industry and decided to part ways.\n\nAfter leaving Muse, Kawai Kenji began composing music for commercials in his home studio. While recording music for [Yuji Mitsuya](https://anilist.co/staff/95874/) he met music director Naoko Asari, who advised him to compose anime soundtracks. Some of his most famous anime soundtracks can be found in [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/1288/), [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), [Fate/Stay Night](https://anilist.co/anime/356/), [When They Cry](https://anilist.co/anime/934/) and more recently in [Mob Psycho 100](https://anilist.co/anime/21507/).\n\nHe has worked on several projects with the director [Mamoru Oshii](https://anilist.co/staff/99097/) and has written scores for all of Hideo Nakata's films. Kenji Kawai's music has received the Annie award and Hong Kong Film Award in 2005, for [Ghost in The Shell 2: Innocence](https://anilist.co/anime/468/) he was nominated for an Annie award.\n\nFollowing his success as an anime music composer, he became involved in live action movies. He contributed music to horror films: Ring, Ring 2, Dark Water, Japanese-Polish science-fiction film Avalon and the Hong Kong film Seven Swords.\n\nFor the music found in Seven Swords and A Battle of Wits he was nominated for Best Original Film Score Awards at both the 25th and 26th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2006 and 2007.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

His career began in 1978, debuting as a mechanical designer on [Toushou Daimos](https://anilist.co/anime/2816/), designing the enemy robots. Few years later in 1981, he made his tokusatsu debut on Robot 8-chan.\n\nThe following decade he worked on industry shaping series such as [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/86/), [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/) and [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/). During this time he also had ties to Parallel Creation, a creative group led by sci-fi writer [Aritsune Toyota](https://anilist.co/staff/220367/). This led him to work as an illustrator on novels such as [Record of Lodoss War](https://anilist.co/manga/92655/), in which his designs were deeply influential for Japanese fantasy series.\n\nIn 2002, he directed [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), an anime original created by him.
