Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket (short for Comic Market, a comic convention bi-annually held in Japan). He used the pen name Awa Mizuno (水野亜和). Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His \"A Kid's Game for One Summer\" was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated.    \n\nAfter a big hit with A.I. Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga, Love Hina. The series appeared in Weekly Shonen Magazine and has been collected in eleven volumes (with fourteen volumes in total), which have sold over 6 million copies in Japan, and received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen in 2001.  Akamatsu had added elements of his own life experiences to the story, and this was said to have induced a unique feeling to the manga especially for Western readers, whose lack of familiarity with Japanese culture for the most part added to the effect. The series, published in America in 2002, was especially well received in many overseas countries - Akamatsu was surprised that even foreign readers found Love Hina to be \"cute\" and to their liking.    \n\nHe is now married to his wife 'Kanon' Akamatsu, who was previously a singer/idol.\n\nSince 2022, he has held a seat in the House of Councillors proportional representation block of the National Diet.",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/新房昭之) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Shinbo)\n\nAkiyuki Shinbou is a Japanese director, producer, animator and storyboard artist. He joined Studio One Pattern in 1981. He made his directorial debut with [Metal Fighter Miku](https://anilist.co/anime/1175/) in 1994. He joined Shaft in 2004. He has received the 11th Tokyo Anime Award and the 2011 Newtype Anime Award for Best director for his work on the acclaimed anime series [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/).\n\nShinbou was born in Fukushima Prefecture. After high school, he attended Tokyo Designer Institute before entering the anime industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo Design Institute, Shinbou worked as an animator for the 1981 anime series [Urusei Yatsura](https://anilist.co/anime/1293/). Shinbou participated with Studio Pierrot in 1990 as an episode director in [Musashi](https://anilist.co/anime/8065/). His first full directorial debut was however the previously mentioned, with Metal Fighter Miku. He continued his early directional career with several OVA series in the late 90's. Shinbou participated with Seven Arcs starting with [Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever](https://anilist.co/anime/176/) in 2003 and then became director for 2004's spin-off [Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha](https://anilist.co/anime/76/).\n\nHis style in particular became noticed during his episode direction work on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/)'s Dark Tournament arc. After seeing Shinbou's stylized presence, the new president of Shaft, [Mitsutoshi Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/151830/), approached Shinbou with the desire to make Shaft a distinctive studio among animation companies. In an interview, Kubota cited [Le Portrait de Petit Cossette](https://anilist.co/anime/514/) and [The SoulTaker](https://anilist.co/anime/1048/) among Shinbou's most distinctive products that caught his eye.\n\nHis work at Shaft has been characterized by extensive experimentation within the visual medium of animation, and often includes pictures taken from real life cut into scenes, as well as art shifts, beat panels, kabuki sound effects, textures that remain stationary when the textured object moves, showing symbols or defining parts of a character in place of characters during dialogue, written text in place (in opposition to dialogue), precise use of fan service, and \"head-tilting\", a style known as a Shaft specialty.\n\nHe says that the reason he sticks with Shaft is due to their system and professional capacity, which make his expression of direction much easier. The so-called \"Team Shinbou\" includes himself, [Tatsuya Oishi](https://anilist.co/staff/103552/) and [Shin Oonuma](https://anilist.co/staff/101753/).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Oishi worked at Studio Junio at the beginning of his career, and soon after joined [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/). There he debuted as a key animator on [Mobile Suit Victory Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/89/) in 1993. [Hideyuki Morioka](https://anilist.co/staff/101526/) and [You Yoshinari](https://anilist.co/staff/102998/) were among his co-workers at the studio. In 1994, Oishi got involved on [Yu Yu Hakusho](https://anilist.co/anime/392/) as a key animator and during its production he met [Akiyuki Shinbou](https://anilist.co/staff/100089/), a prolific episode director on the series and a to be long-time colleague and friend of his. Oishi continued working as a freelance animator through the '90s.\n\nIn 2001, he made his directorial debut with the 46th episode of [Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier](https://anilist.co/anime/1678/). Soon after this he started getting involved in studio [Shaft](https://anilist.co/studio/44/)'s works with aforementioned Shinbou. In 2009, Shinbou and him directed [Bakemonogatari](https://anilist.co/anime/5081/) together, with Oishi serving as the chief director. In 2016, he directed the movie trilogy [Kizumonogatari](https://anilist.co/anime/9260/), which is considered to be his magnum-opus. Oishi usually draws his works' storyboards himself, and is known for taking a long time finishing them. Kizumonogatari's storyboards took him several years to complete.\n\n[Naoyuki Tatsuwa](https://anilist.co/staff/103584/), who has also been involved in many of Shaft's projects, called him the \"[Togashi](https://anilist.co/staff/96893/) of Shaft.\"",

          "description": "**Birthplace:** Fukuoka, Japan\n\nYukihiro Miyamoto, occasionally nicknamed Otokomatsuri, is a Japanese animator and director. He started at animation studio Vega Entertainment, and later joined Shaft. He is best known for directing Puella Magi Madoka Magica and its subsequent film trilogy alongside Akiyuki Shinbo, the latter trilogy which subsequently garnered ¥2 billion, making it a box-office success.\n\nMiyamoto described himself as being a \"heretic\" at Shaft-- someone who, in a company of many differing directors, is only good at doing \"plain work\", and isn't particularly original or creative. Shinbo described Miyamoto in a similar way, but said that he was more like a professional craftsman who leaves their mark in places that cannot be seen.",
