          "description": "Saeko Chiba took up ballet at a young age with ambitions of becoming part of Takarazuka Revue. However, having failed the entrance exam for Takarazuka Music School in her third year of middle-school she joined the Minami Aoyama Shōjo Kageki Dan (南青山少女歌劇団, also called Nanshō for short) a stage group for teenage girls. Having had several lead roles over the three years she spent with the troupe, Saeko was then cast in the lead voice acting role of Kotori Haruno in the Sega Dreamcast game Diamond Daydreams. Having had a taste of being a seiyū and deciding that she preferred voice acting to performing on stage, Saeko decided to pursue the career full-time.\n\nSaeko has also pursued a singing career with [Yuki Kajiura](https://anilist.co/staff/100077), who wrote music for some of the Nanshō stage shows, writing and producing almost all her material. Her first single was Koi no Kiseki, the theme song for the PlayStation game Meguri Aishite. She has since released nine singles and two albums, along with various character song and drama CDs. She has also performed theme songs for games such as Alundra 2 and Atelier Judie.\n\nSaeko was also part of the group tiaraway with fellow Nanshō member [Yuuka Nanri](https://anilist.co/staff/95366). The duo released three singles and an album before breaking up on March 6 2005.\n\nOn August 26th, 2007 she married (on her 30th birthday), and on February 17, 2011 she gave birth to her first child, a daughter.",
