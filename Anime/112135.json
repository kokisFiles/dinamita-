  "description": "Suzu is a quiet and ordinary -- if not a bit of clumsy and daydreaming -- girl growing up in the outskirts of the city of Hiroshima in mid-1930s. She loves drawing sketches with pencils -- a hobby she is really good at. Following her parents' arrangement in 1943, 18-year-old Suzu is married to a young man living in Kure, a neighboring city with a large naval base, in which he works as a civilian secretary for the military tribunal. There she faces a new life, a new family, as well as many new challenges and hardships, particularly with the worsening life conditions due to the Pacific War. Yet Suzu manages to find happiness and peace in her daily life. \n\nThe concept behind the film is to give the perspective of \"several more lives\" in addition to Suzu's, so it has a new title to reflect the new theme. It will adapt more scenes from the manga.\n<br><br>\nThe new scenes include Suzu crossing paths with Rin in the fall of 1944 and the winter and spring of 1945. Rin features prominently in the new visual above and the video below. Another new segment will focus on the Makurazaki Typhoon of September 1945, while Suzu is worried for her younger sister Sumi.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

She started playing piano when she was 5 years old. After graduating from KOYO SCHOOL OF MUSIC（current・KOYO SCHOOL OF MUSIC&DANCE), she went to study abroad in Boston, then graduated from Berklee College of Music with a Bachelor of Music in Jazz composition and a Bachelor of Music in Performance. In 2006, \"Nichiyomachi (Waiting for Sunday)\" which would become her 2nd single, was on air at the J-WAVE radio audition program \"RADIO SAKAMOTO\" navigated by Ryuichi Sakamoto, then she performed in \"LOHAS CLASSIC Concert\" also produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto. In the same year, she released \"Konnichiwa mata ashita (Hello & See you)” produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto as her debut single in Japan. Since then, she has released 11 solo albums and 7 soundtrack albums. The latest solo album is “Ame no hakoniwa (My garden in the rain)” released in 2017. She composed the whole score in a long-running hit animated movie “Konosekai no Katasumi ni (In This Corner of the World)” released in November 2016, which led to her winning the 40th Japan Academy Film Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Music, the 71st Mainichi Film Awards for Best Music, and Best Music Award in the Osaka Cinema Festival 2017. Music of “In This Corner of the World” Concert, which represented the movie in a music concert, was well-received all over the country. At present, she has earned a high reputation as a singer-songwriter, composer and pianist with works on soundtracks for movies, dramas, animations, and commercials, and has a deeper expression of orchestra arrangements as well as performances. In recent years, the range of her voice expressions has expanded, including narration. In 2018, she visited Argentina on her first overseas tour, making all six performances a huge success and gained worldwide acclaim. She is now active as an artist who draws a pop world full of floating feelings with outstanding piano performance and soft singing voice.",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
