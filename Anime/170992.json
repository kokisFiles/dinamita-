Later on they acquired the drummer Nakanishi in 2017. However, Rocoru graduated from the group in 2019.\n\nSome of their most popular songs include \"Suki Kirai\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\" and \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\". Their music style consists mostly of positive rocky songs.\n\nIn January 2014 they had their first major debut, with the album \"<i>Zutto Maekara Suki Deshita</i>.\", which ranked in fourth place on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oricon\">Oricon</a>. In May 2014, the start-up of \"<i>CHiCO with HoneyWorks</i>\" was announced. Sometime in early 2019, the circle began to include subunits: s×c, a duo comprised of shito and cake; and HoneyMonster, comprised of Gom (Kouto), cake, and Nakanishi. The circle also created a number of fictional idols, such as LIP×LIP and Dolce.\n\nIn addition, ten light novels, based on the <a href=\"https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Confession_Executive_Committee_Love_Series\">Confession Executive Committee Love Series</a> songs \"Kokuhaku Yokou Renshuu\", \"Yakimochi no Kotae\", \"Hatsukoi no Ehon\", \"Ima ni Suki Naru.\", \"Koi-Iro ni Sake\", \"Kinyoubi no Ohayou\", \"Heart no Shuchou\", \"Ijiwaru na Deai\", \"Boku ga Namae wo Yobu Hi\", and \"Daikirai na Hazu Datta.\" have been released so far.
