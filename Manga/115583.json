  "description": "Yamane Akaneko and her classmate Tsujishima meet one day in the mostly deserted second school library and discover a supernatural secret. A demon that seems like an ordinary red cat possesses Tsujishima and insists that they help him in his task to protect the books of the library. Apparently, all books that are internally consistent enough have a world that exists within them. These books are plagued by \"bookworms,\" which look like long cats, that eat up words and change the story until its reality is destroyed. The three of them, Yamane, Tsujishima, and the possessing cat demon, journey into the worlds of many books to track down and catch the bookworms before they do too much damage! <br><br>(Source: MangaHelpers)",

          "description": "Izumi Takemoto is a mangaka born in Tokyo, Japan, though he grew up in Saitama. He attended Nihon University and majored in business. His first experience with science fiction was through the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the majority of his works reflect this SF influence.\n\nHe is also a cat lover, and while cats frequently appear in his works, he had never owned a cat until 2003. He used his first experiences with his cat when he wrote Aru Hi no Zwei.\n\nHis artwork has a distinctive, soft style, and it stands out among that of his contemporaries in Japan. He is one of the few mangaka to publish in three of the four major mainstream manga markets in Japan: shoujo, shounen, and seinen manga. Takemoto was the character designer for several computer and console games as well.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
