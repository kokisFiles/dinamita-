  "description": "A tiny mountain village in a remote woodland region. Five primary school kids have come together in this idyllic spot in order to spend their summer holidays at a camp. At first the children enjoy carefree days amidst unspoiled nature far away from adult supervision. But their life changes dramatically when they come across what they believe to be a small dog, badly in need of help. The creature &ndash; known as Pochi &ndash; turns out not to be a dog at all but an alien on an important mission. <br><br>\nIt seems there is a mysterious substance on earth that is coveted throughout the universe. Pochi had almost found it but was so badly injured during a fight that he had to give up his search. Thanks to the children's help, the alien survives &ndash; and decides to reward them generously. &ldquo;Where would you most like to travel?&rdquo; is the question Pochi puts to his rescuers. Their answer is prompt, if vague: <br>\n&ldquo;As far as possible!&rdquo; Pochi suggests they try the moon first of all, and so, the alien whisks away the kids to the satellite next door. This marks the beginning of an absolutely amazing adventure. <br><br>\nDuring the course of their travels they discover that the substance coveted throughout the universe is in fact also integral to Japanese cuisine &ndash; and it just so happens that one of the kids has some of this mysterious substance in his pocket.<br><br>\n(Source: Berlinale.de)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/747930872179875840)\n\nA pioneer in the field of realist animation, and then digital processing.\n\nDebuted uncredited as an in-betweneer on [Zeta Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/85/). He made his initial splash in [Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket](https://anilist.co/anime/82/), and continued to develop his approach to animation which he calls \"full limited,\" which eliminated the pose-to-pose feel of conventional keyframe animation. His characteristic animation can be seen in [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) and [End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/).\n\nIn [Blood: The Last Vampire](https://anilist.co/anime/405/), Iso experimented with digital processing of his hand-drawn fire effects, elevating it to uncanny realism. Iso then got his first taste of directing in [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/) episode 15, which he largely animated and also digitally processed himself.\n\nHis animation sensibilities, process innovations, experience in multiple levels of anime production, and interest in technology culminated in the 2007 sci-fi series, [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/), his veritable brainchild. During its production, there was a rumored falling-out with key staff. For the next several years, Iso would quietly animate under the pseudonym Mikio Odagawa.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2018, he announced his retirement as an animator to focus exclusively on directing.",

He is also praised for his shot composition skills and copies of his layouts are widely distributed in the industry as drawing reference. Nowadays he is mostly only credited for character design in the shows he participates in, but in reality he works as an animation director uncredited quite often. He rarely heavily corrects the key animator's cuts, strongly believing that the animators' distinctiveness should be noticeable.\n\nNoted for his designs on shows like [Haikyuu](https://anilist.co/anime/20464/), [Serial Experiments Lain](https://anilist.co/anime/339/), [Madoka Magica](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/), [Baccano](https://anilist.co/anime/2251/) and more.",

He initially failed an examination test for [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/) but was later scouted by the late [Osamu Kobayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/100406/) for [Beck](https://anilist.co/anime/57/). There he met noted animators [Norio Matsumoto](https://anilist.co/staff/100991/) and [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/), the former which he would work with on numerous occasions afterwards.\n\nHis breakthrough as an animator was on [Noein](https://anilist.co/anime/584/), a series directed by [Kazuki Akane](https://anilist.co/staff/102416/). The 12th episode was highly regarded by animation fans and other animators for the given display by him and Matsumoto. He would later also serve as a character designer on [Birdy the Mighty: Decode](https://anilist.co/anime/3974/), another series directed by Akane.\n\nHis dedication for animation could also be seen on [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/), for which he animated a minute-long scene of the main character running down a street. He went on the actual street in Tokyo to film himself for reference footage for the cut.",
