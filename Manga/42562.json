  "description": "In the manga industry, there is a legend: If you leave a message on a bulletin board at a Shibuya train station, you can obtain the services of a certain man: Comic Master J, an assistant mangaka who can instantly complete any publication manuscript in any art style for the price of 5 million yen. However, he refuses to work on manga without a \"soul.\" But what is J's true identity? Why does he wear an overcoat lined with pens and rulers? And for what reason does a man of such artistic talent choose to live in the shadows of the industry, rather than working on a manga of his own creation? ",

He would ultimately find critical acclaim with his *Comic Master J* in 1996. At some point in the 1990s, he befriended Yoshiaki Tabata, and following their collaboration on the 1999 indie film *Battle Yaro* (conceptualized by Yogo), the two would go on to continue collaborating on numerous works throughout the years - most notably *Akumetsu*, *Wolf Guy*, *Shin Mazinger Zero*, and the 2013 manga adaptation of *Ninja Slayer* - with Yogo providing the art and Tabata writing the scripts.\n\nHis notable non-manga works include designing Hijikata Toshizou for the mobile game *Fate/Grand Order* and providing Bugnaraku Empire monster design for the tokusatsu show *Ohsama Sentai Kingohger*. He has also contributed art for Akita Shoten's 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami relief charity auction, as well as celebratory illustrations for Weekly Shonen Champion's 50th anniversary and the 30th anniversary of *Urayasu Tekkin Kazoku*.\n\nHe has a habit of using Ninjahead slang and catchphrases in his commentary and social media, regardless of whether he's commenting on something Ninja Slayer-related or not.",
