Kaori is assigned to guard Emi, but they both get caught up in the Professor's scheme. The City Hunter must save them, without allowing downtown Tokyo to be destroyed.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "John Ledford is an entrepreneur and leader in the North American anime industry. In 1992, he founded A.D. Vision (ADV), paving the way for other businesses and the exponential growth anime has had within North America. With ADV's success, Ledford turned his sights to making the imaginative world of anime even more accessible with Anime Network's founding, North America’s first cable TV network dedicated to anime. He later partnered with Kadokawa Publishing and began Newtype USA with translated Japanese content and exclusive U.S. material related to all things anime, manga, and model reviews. This endeavor expanded into ADV Manga, which obtained licensing and publishing rights for hundreds of Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.\n\nIn 2008, Ledford founded a new anime-focused company called Sentai Filmworks (Sentai). Since its founding, Sentai provides thousands of hours of content across traditional and digital platforms. Sentai’s dedication to bringing captivating stories, including acclaimed titles such as Grave of the Fireflies, Ninja Scroll, and High School of the Dead to audiences, is ongoing.\n\nLedford’s most recent success is with the 2017 founding of the streaming service HIDIVE. Since launching, HIDIVE is now available via a web browser, mobile devices, gaming platforms, and more. HIDIVE offers new simulcasts every season, an ever-growing collection of dubs, and exclusive titles. The service features DUBCAST SM editions, early access local-language dubs of simulcasts directly produced by HIDIVE, as early as two weeks after the original Japanese broadcast.\n\nFor nearly thirty years now, Ledford continues his goal to further the expansion of anime and the Japanese culture as a whole.",

By 1988, Maps had evolved into the band Humming Bird for which Fukuyama is often remembered. Initially, Humming Bird had only two official members: Yoshiki Fukuyama on guitar and vocals and Toshiyuki Furuya on bass and vocals. Various friends also played. The final band roster was set in 1992 with the official addition of Shoichiro Aso on drums. Humming Bird enjoyed moderate success, having released nine albums before disbanding in May 2000.  Humming Bird played a blend of rock and folk with roots in the hard rock and roll of the 1960s to 1980s, such as Queen, The Beatles, and The Eagles. They are often considered the “real life” equivalent to the fictional band Fire Bomber that was made famous in the anime Macross 7. Most of the time, the work was merely credited to Fire Bomber, although Fukuyama’s name does appear in the songwriting credits of several songs. Both Fukuyama and Humming Bird are both listed in the “Thank You” section of all the Fire Bomber album credits. Humming Bird has also “covered” some Fire Bomber songs (e.g., “My Soul For You,” “Dynamite Explosion), which appear on their albums. (Source: Last.fm)",
