  "description": "A skilled carpenter/sculptor Jingoro, gets set up by his disciples and loses his right arm and his father in an \"accident\" during the reconstruction of the Edo Castle. A few decades later… Jingoro is continuing his journey of revenge with his partner “Sleeping Cat” and his weaponized prosthetic arm. People have come to call him Jingoro \"Hidari,\" which means \"left\" in Japanese.<br><br>\n\nJingoro defeats all the foes that has betrayed him, but he learns that Tokugawa Shogunate was behind the murderous event. He searches for clues on who was behind the whole set up, and fights with an army of mechanical soldiers along the way. Finally he confronts the mastermind behind all the killings, but first, he must save the city of Edo by stopping the Edo Castle, now turned into a gigantic weapon of mass destruction!<br><br>\n(Source: Official Website)",
