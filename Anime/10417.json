The fish are fused to metal legs and are infected with a disease contractable by humans that was invented as a weapon by unknown sources. After what happens to Tadashi, Kaori finds herself in a new world very much like the old one but with the stench of death. ",

          "description": "__Spouse:__ [Ishiguro Ayako (石黒亜矢子)](https://twitter.com/ishiguroayako)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/junjiitofficial)\n\n__Introduction:__\nJunji Itou is a Japanese writer, penciller, inker and mangaka, who is best known for his horror manga. Some of his notable works include [The Enigma of Amigara Fault](https://anilist.co/manga/112978/The-Enigma-of-Amigara-Fault/), [Tomie](https://anilist.co/manga/30912/Tomie/), [Uzumaki](https://anilist.co/manga/30436/Uzumaki-Spiral-into-Horror/), and [Gyo](https://anilist.co/manga/30909/Gyo/).\n\nHe was inspired from a young age by both his older sisters' drawings and the work of [Kazuo Umezu](https://anilist.co/staff/97777/Kazuo-Umezu). Itou first began writing and drawing manga as a hobby while working as a dental technician in the early 1990s. In 1987, he submitted a short story to Gekkan Halloween that won an honorable mention in the Kazuo Umezu Prize (with Umezu himself as one of the judges). This story was later serialized as Tomie.\n\nIn addition to [Kazuo Umezu](https://anilist.co/staff/97777/Kazuo-Umezu), Itou has cited [Hideshi Hino](https://anilist.co/staff/99735/Hideshi-Hino), [Shinichi Koga](https://anilist.co/staff/119971/Shinichi-Koga), [Yasutaka Tsutsui](https://anilist.co/staff/97488/Yasutaka-Tsutsui) and [H.P. Lovecraft](https://anilist.co/staff/101086/H-P-Lovecraft) as being major influences to his work. The universe Itou depicts is cruel and capricious, his characters often find themselves victims of malevolent unnatural circumstances for no discernible reason, or they are punished out of proportion for minor infractions against an unknown and incomprehensible natural order. Some of the recurring themes of Itou's work include body horror, seemingly ordinary characters who begin to act out of irrational compulsion, the breakdown of society, deep-sea organisms, and the inevitability of one's demise.\n\nFilm director Guillermo del Toro cited on his official Twitter account that Itou was originally a collaborator for the video game Silent Hills, of which both Del Toro and game designer [Hideo Kojima](https://anilist.co/staff/100732/Hideo-Kojima) were the main directors, however, a year after its announcement the project was canceled by [Konami](https://anilist.co/studio/85/Konami), the IP's owner. Itou and Del Toro would later lend their likenesses towards Kojima's next project, Death Stranding.\n\nIn 2006, Junji married Ishiguro Ayako, who is a picture book artist. As of 2013, they have two children. In 2019, Itou received an Eisner Award for his manga adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.",

Married to [Momoko Kamiya](https://anilist.co/staff/250361).\n\nUpon enrolling at Osaka University of Arts, Yuuichi Terao, alongside [Takashi Suhara](https://anilist.co/staff/146678/Takashi-Suhara) and others, embarked on the autonomous creation of animated films, even organizing screenings through university circles in the Kanto region. After joining animation production company ufotable in December 2003, Terao, initially aspiring for the production department as a production manager but he was assigned to the newly formed photography department (now the Digital Imaging Department) due to presenting visual materials during his interview. Despite lacking prior photography expertise, he learned from scratch, commencing his career as a compositor. From 2007 onwards, Terao transitioned to the role of \"Director of Photography\" in notable works such as \"The Garden of Sinners.\" Presently serving as Chief of ufotable's Digital Imaging Department, he oversees photography and CG, contributing significantly to ufotable's works. Beyond photography and CG, Terao actively engages in various roles, including animation, background sections, directing, and storyboarding, even participating in the early stages of background art creation. Noteworthy for his involvement in promotional videos and commercials, Terao gained attention for creating faction-specific commercials for the TV anime [Fate/Zero](https://anilist.co/anime/10087/FateZero/) in 2011. \n\nHis directorial contributions extend to ufotable works' opening sequences and game animations, with a notable debut as a storyboard artist and director in the final episode of the 2019 TV anime [Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/). Terao's multifaceted contributions align with his belief in animation as a collective art form, emphasizing teamwork in production. \n\nRecognized for his expertise in integrating 3DCG seamlessly with characters and background art, Terao's artistic approach aims for high-quality animation. His \"photorealistic\" visuals, adopted since 2007, have been praised, contributing to his receipt of the Tokyo Anime Award 2022's \"Individual Award\".",

          "description": "Affiliated with [ufotable](https://anilist.co/studio/43/), where he currently serves as the chief of the ufotable Art Department.\n\nWith a career spanning over 50 years in the anime industry, Ebisawa is recognized as one of the longest-serving background artists. He made his debut in 1969, contributing to the art staff of [Himitsu no Akko-chan](https://anilist.co/anime/3285/Himitsu-no-Akkochan/). Over the years, Ebisawa freelanced for various studios, leaving his artistic mark on iconic scenes in productions like [Lupin III: Lupin vs. the Clone](https://anilist.co/anime/1435/Lupin-III-The-Secret-of-Mamo/), [Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/Macross-Do-You-Remember-Love/), and others.\n\nIn 1980, he took on the role of art director for [Cyborg 009: Legend of the Super Galaxy](https://anilist.co/anime/7336/Cyborg-009-Legend-of-the-Super-Galaxy/), initiating a career in art direction for theatrical and OVA productions. Despite his reluctance for the position, he continued to contribute to notable works. After a hiatus from the role, he returned as art director for [The Garden of Sinners: Chapter 4 – The Hollow Shrine](https://anilist.co/anime/4280/the-Garden-of-sinners-Chapter-4-garannodou-The-Hollow-Shrine/) in 2008.\n\nEbisawa's unique approach includes hand-drawing backgrounds using traditional methods like paper, brushes, and poster colors, a style that distinguishes him in an era dominated by digital techniques. Notably, he personally handled the majority of cuts in The Garden of Sinners: Chapter 4 – The Hollow Shrine.\n\nIn 2018, at the age of 65, Ebisawa expanded his role by taking on the position of art director for the anime series [Today's Menu for the Emiya Family](https://anilist.co/anime/100855/Todays-Menu-for-the-Emiya-Family/). His contributions extend beyond individual projects, as he plays a crucial role in training new talents at ufotable, As part of the training program for new staff, they are obliged to work exclusively on hand-drawn background art using poster colors, similar to Ebisawa's style, for a certain period after joining the company. This practice aims to improve the drawing skills of the art staff, resulting in the inclusion of hand-drawn backgrounds in many ufotable works. Throughout his career, Ebisawa's dedication to the artistry of animation has left an indelible mark on the industry.",
