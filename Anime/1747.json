After having graduated high school in 1973, he left Miyagi, heading to Tokyo with the hopes of becoming a mangaka. He made his debut later on the same year with a manga adaptation of Prosper Mérimée's short novel Mateo Falcone, titled A Gun Report. In 1979, after writing multiple short-stories for the magazine Action, Ootomo created his first science-fiction work, titled Fireball. Although the manga was never completed, it is regarded as a milestone in Ootomo's career, containing many of the same themes he would later explore in [Doumu](https://anilist.co/manga/31215/), which began serialization in January 1980 and ran for two years until completed.\n\nIn 1982, Ootomo made his anime debut as character designer on [Harmagedon](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/). After this Ootomo began working on Akira, which would become his most acclaimed and famous work. The manga took eight years to complete and would eventually culminate in 2000 pages of artwork.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Eventually, a recording contract with Toshiba-EMI was signed and, under the stage name Cubic U, Utada released their English-language debut album Precious in early 1998, but it was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, their Japanese-language debut First Love was released and became an instant success. Backed by the massive success of singles \"Automatic,\" \"Time Will Tell,\" and \"Movin' On Without You,\" the album sold two million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the Oricon charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six million more throughout the rest of 1999. First Love eventually became the country's best-selling album of all time.\n\nBy the end of the '00s, Utada was deemed \"the most influential artist of the decade\" in the Japanese music landscape by The Japan Times. Utada's commercial success has made them one of Japan's top-selling recording artists of all time with over 37 million records sold since launching their career in the late '90s. Twelve of their singles have reached number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart, while ten of their albums have become chart-toppers. Six of their full-length releases are among the country's highest-selling albums of all time, including First Love, Distance and Deep River, which are among the top ten best-selling records of Japan's music history.\n\nUtada has performed theme songs for all of the four [Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/2759/) reboot movies, as well as for [Freedom](https://anilist.co/anime/1747/) and [To Your Eternity](https://anilist.co/anime/114535/).\n\nAdditionally, they are also known by international audiences for writing and producing four theme-songs to the video game series Kingdom Hearts.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Hamasu's animation mainly focuses on character acting, and his scenes often feature minimal camerawork with a heavy emphasis on expressive facial and body animation. Much like [Kouichi Arai](https://anilist.co/staff/121208/), he was heavily influenced by [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/) and the late '80s realism. Early in his career he was employed at Toei Animation, and was thus a recurring presence in the studio's OVA works such as [Xanadu](https://anilist.co/anime/5920/), [Crying Freeman](https://anilist.co/anime/1153/) and [Vampire Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/1765/). His rising prominence during the early '90s allowed him to participate on [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/), and from thereon he has been in high demand for feature films.\n\nIn 1993, Hamasu animated the car chase on [Satoshi Kon](https://anilist.co/staff/99580/)’s episode of the [JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/666/). The scene impressed Kon enough for Hamasu to end up as a character designer and animation director on [Perfect Blue](https://anilist.co/anime/437/). He was also set to serve a similar role in [Millennium Actress](https://anilist.co/anime/1033/), but was replaced in the role by [Takeshi Honda](https://anilist.co/staff/103303/) due to having contracted a severe tendon inflammation. He appeared on all of Kon’s films, as well as [Paranoia Agent](https://anilist.co/anime/323/) until the director's passing.\n\nMore recently he has mostly worked on [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) and [Hosoda](https://anilist.co/staff/100067/)'s films.",
