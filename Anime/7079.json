  "description": "The story follows Hiroshi Kuzumi, a 16-year-old student who has just moved to the seemingly serene village of Jogamachi. Nestled in the mountains far away from the city, the village is divided by a river that separates old Jogamachi from new Jogamachi. Young Hiroshi soon discovers that the village is ancient as well as mysterious traditions and customs have been kept alive over the ages. Although a bit bewildered by the new environment, Hiroshi begins to settle into his new life. While he has never been the type to win any popularity contests, he quickly earns the affection of his classmates. That is with the exception of aloof class president, Nemuru Kushinada, whose only words to Hiroshi are a warning to stay away from old part of town. It is there that terror and mystery await him.",

Their group name derives from the diner hangout in the TV show Beverly Hills 90210. Although both have similar styles, with some artwork it is possible to identify which artist drew it. Both are known for their bishoujo styled works. As noted in their books, they are both Geminis and have \"Almost flushed our phones down the toilet... twice.\"\n\nThe two of them grew up together and went to the same elementary school and have been best friends ever since. Both started as doujinshi manga artists, but not as Peach-Pit. Then they were scouted by Dengeki Comic Gao!.",

Her father was a big fan of classical and opera music and always desired for Yuki to play the piano for him. Yuki eventually gained a love for music and a love for the piano. Yuki started out as an SE programmer, but changed to music in 1992. She made her grand debut with a female trio called \"[See-Saw](https://anilist.co/staff/104342).\"  In the years to come the group released six singles and two albums. \n\nYuki then went on to work on her solo career composing for artists and some TV, films, and games, such as _Blood: The Last Vampire_ in 2001, and _Xenosaga II_ and _III_. In 2001, Yuki's claim to fame came with the release of the anime [_NOIR_](https://anilist.co/anime/272). The soundtrack sold 50,000 copies. In 2002, she was brought on to project .hack to write the score to [_.hack//SIGN_](https://anilist.co/anime/48), along with vocalist [Chiaki Ishikawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101059) and New York singer [Emily Bindiger](https://anilist.co/staff/103845). Shortly after Yuki comprised an album of original and complied songs known as Fiction, working again with Emily Bindiger as well as _Xenosaga_ vocalist Deb Lyons.  \n\nYuki's other well-known works were for [_Mobile Suite Gundam Seed_](https://anilist.co/anime/93), which hit 5th on the Oricon Charts its first week, and selling over 200,000 copies.

Her father was a big fan of classical and opera music and always desired for Yuki to play the piano for him. Yuki eventually gained a love for music and a love for the piano. Yuki started out as an SE programmer, but changed to music in 1992. She made her grand debut with a female trio called \"[See-Saw](https://anilist.co/staff/104342).\"  In the years to come the group released six singles and two albums. \n\nYuki then went on to work on her solo career composing for artists and some TV, films, and games, such as _Blood: The Last Vampire_ in 2001, and _Xenosaga II_ and _III_. In 2001, Yuki's claim to fame came with the release of the anime [_NOIR_](https://anilist.co/anime/272). The soundtrack sold 50,000 copies. In 2002, she was brought on to project .hack to write the score to [_.hack//SIGN_](https://anilist.co/anime/48), along with vocalist [Chiaki Ishikawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101059) and New York singer [Emily Bindiger](https://anilist.co/staff/103845). Shortly after Yuki comprised an album of original and complied songs known as Fiction, working again with Emily Bindiger as well as _Xenosaga_ vocalist Deb Lyons.  \n\nYuki's other well-known works were for [_Mobile Suite Gundam Seed_](https://anilist.co/anime/93), which hit 5th on the Oricon Charts its first week, and selling over 200,000 copies. Yuki has also become known for her work on CLAMP's [_Tsubasa Chronicle_](https://anilist.co/anime/177) series, [movie](https://anilist.co/anime/807), and [OVAs](https://anilist.co/anime/2685). In 2003, she formed the project [FictionJunction](https://anilist.co/staff/103691) in which pairs Yuki's songwriting and composition with different performing vocalists, first as separate solo works and later into a singular group. In 2007, Yuki formed the band [Kalafina](https://anilist.co/staff/101975), with two partners from FictionJunction, Wakana Ootaki and [Keiko Kubota](https://anilist.co/staff/104664), to perform for the anime [_Kara no Kyoukai_](https://anilist.co/anime/2593), further working on several others. Kalafina disbanded in 2018, with their final lineup including Wakana, Keiko, and [Hikaru](https://anilist.co/staff/168857).",
