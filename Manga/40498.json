She is an only child. Her professional debut was in 1993. \n\nMany of her stories draw on tales of historical or fantasy Europe, with swords and magic and dragons and men in tights. Along these lines, almost all of her stories involve themes of homosexual relationships between two men. Comic artists who influenced her work include Osamu Tezuka, Hayao Miyazaki, and the Showa 24 generation of women manga artists led by Moto Hagio who created girls' comics in the 1970s. \n\nShe visited Germany several times in the past and, according to her, the \"castle Neuschwanstein\" is one of her favourite places in the world. Many of her stories are inspired by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. ",
