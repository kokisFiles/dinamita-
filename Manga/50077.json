  "description": "In the near future on the starship Galaxy, Sheryl Nome lived with her parents Abel and Sally. The government tracked her parents down who were rebelling against mandatory human enhancing implants and Sheryl was the only one who got away alive. Barely surviving on her own on the streets, Grace O&rsquo;Connor, a manager at a talent agency brings her in to make her a star. Several years later Sheryl is enrolled into the Erato Music School where she meets Amagi Lilies, a brilliant singer and they become friends. However, tragedy strikes and Lilies dies trying to save Sheryl. To make sure her parent&rsquo;s sacrifice was not in vain and to keep her promise with Lilies, Sheryl enters into the entertainment world to become the greatest singer in the universe.<br><br>\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

          "description": "Shouji Kawamori is an anime creator, director and mechanical designer. Also a current advisor for [Satelight](https://anilist.co/studio/41/).\n\nFamous for his work in the [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) and Transformers franchises. He pioneered several innovative concepts in his works, such as transforming mecha (including the VF-1 Valkyrie in Macross and Optimus Prime in Transformers) and virtual idols (including Lynn Minmay and Sharon Apple in the Macross franchise).\n\nKawamori attended Keio University together with Macross screenwriter [Hiroshi Oonogi](https://anilist.co/staff/97701/) and character designer [Haruhiko Mikimoto](https://anilist.co/staff/96968/). There they became friends and founded a [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) fan club called \"Gunsight One,\" a name the group would use years later during the development of the fictional world of the Macross series. Later on his career Kawamori created or co-created the concepts which served as basis for several anime series. His projects are usually noted to contain strong themes of love, war, spirituality or mysticism, and ecological concern.\n\nKawamori also helped to design various toys for the Takara toyline, Diaclone in the early '80s. Among them the first Optimus Prime toy design, Prowl, Bluestreak, Smokescreen, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Over 20 years later, he returned to Transformers by designing both the Hybrid Style Convoy and the Masterpiece version of Starscream for Takara.",
