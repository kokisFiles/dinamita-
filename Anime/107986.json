  "description": "An animated motion picture about a real-life Buddhist monk and renowned poet, Ryoukan who lived in 18th century Japan, during the Edo Period. Though born to a wealthy family in Izumozaki, Ryoukan chooses to abandon the easy life he would have inherited in order to understand the true meaning of life through the teachings of Buddhism. From his early adulthood, he undergoes a series of harsh training that demands a solitary and meager lifestyle. Throughout it all, he remains an extremely modest and humble person, a true humanitarian who accepts every individual for who they are while rejecting all worldly fame and wealth. Ryoukan found true peace in life through nature and spending time with children. His pure mind and affable personality have captivated many, and his legacy and the wisdom of his teachings live on today.\n<br><br>\n(Source: ATTKC)",

          "description": "[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shichiro_kobayashi/)\n\nA former art director and a guest professor at Kobe Design University.\n\nKobayashi graduated from Musashino Art University and first became an elementary school art teacher. It was only later that he joined the animation industry in 1964. He started quickly making a name for himself as a background artist and consequently established his own background art studio Kobayashi Production, in 1968. During this time thick poster paint was dominating the backgrounds in anime, but Kobayashi started a new style with much thinner painting and colored pencil strokes.\n\nHe has worked as an art director on over 100 titles and is one of the most distinguished art directors in the medium. Notable works include [Gamba no Bouken](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/), [Ie Naki Ko](https://anilist.co/anime/2828/), [Takarajima](https://anilist.co/anime/2618/), [Tenshi no Tamago](https://anilist.co/anime/885/), [Utena](https://anilist.co/anime/440/), [Berserk](https://anilist.co/anime/33/) and [Nodame Cantabile](https://anilist.co/anime/1698/).\n\nKobayashi retired from the industry in 2010, which was followed by his studio's closedown a year later.\n\nIn a 2015 [interview](https://youtu.be/V1tiKOsCz2M), Kobayashi talked about his life and passion in painting touring his atelier and showcasing his work.",
