          "description": "[Website](http://www.clamp-net.com) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CLAMP_news) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clamp_4_official/)\n\nCLAMP is an all-female Japanese manga artist group that formed in the mid-1980s. It consists of leader [Nanase Ohkawa](https://anilist.co/staff/97292), and three artists who shift roles for each series: [Mokona](https://anilist.co/staff/100802) (もこな), [Tsubaki Nekoi](https://anilist.co/staff/100804), and Satsuki Igarashi (いがらし寒月). Almost 100 million CLAMP tankōbon copies have been sold worldwide as of October 2007.\n\nIn general, Ohkawa gets her inspiration for the group from everyday events such as dreams or the news. Unlike most manga artists who specialize in a single genre, CLAMP has created a diverse body of work. CLAMP's genres vary widely, from childish and comedic (<i>Cardcaptor Sakura, Clamp School Detectives</i>) to more dramatic and teen-rated (<i>xxxHolic, X</i>) series. Furthermore, drawing from the idea of Osamu Tezuka's <i>Star System</i> as they did in <i>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle</i>, CLAMP often crossover characters from their own series into their other works, which gives rise to a loosely defined \"Clamp Universe\".",

          "description": "A native of Tokyo, Noriyuki Asakura made his debut into the music industry in 1982, performing the theme song for a TV series. Since then his career has expanded in the direction of composing and producing, including writing songs for pop artists such as Hikaru Nishida and Kahoru Kohiruimaki. But as his creative interests began to diversify, he started focusing more on soundtrack composition for TV, anime, games and motion pictures. His dual experience in both pop and soundtrack production makes him one of the very few individuals capable of producing high quality material in either field. Noriyuki's musical savvy is featured in the soundtrack for the popular animation series \"Rurouni Kenshin\" (1995), and the international success of PlayStation game \"Tenchu\"(1998) gave people all around the world a chance to experience his unique Pan-Asian sound. Currently he has just finished working on the soundtrack for \"Tenchu 2\", and is looking for opportunities in Hollywood in which his musical style - which fuses elements from throughout Asia, spanning from the Middle East and Western Asia to traditional Chinese and Japanese - can be used as a vehicle to move and excite the listener in a way that only he can do.

She was also the winner of the \"Best Musical Performance\" award in the first Seiyuu Awards. She was also part of the quartet Prits alongside Yumiko Kobayashi, Natsuko Kuwatani, and Hisayo Mochizuki (all four voiced characters in the anime _Sister Princess_). Her singing style comes from singing Enka since she was young.\n\nIn July 2020, she married someone from the music industry, and they had their first child on March 16, 2021.\n\n__Non-Anime Roles:__\n- Ittasha in Bakuage Sentai Boonboomger",
