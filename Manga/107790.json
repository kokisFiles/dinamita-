  "description": "<i>Mine has been a life of much shame.</i>\n<br><br>\n<i>I can’t even guess myself what it must be to live the life of a human being.</i>\n<br><br>\nPlagued by a maddening anxiety, the terrible disconnect between his own concept of happiness and the joy of the rest of the world, Yozo Oba plays the clown in his dissolute life, holding up a mask for those around him as he spirals ever downward, locked arm-in-arm with death.\n<br><br>\nOsamu Dazai’s immortal—and supposedly autobiographical—work of Japanese literature, is perfectly adapted here into a manga by Junji Itou. The imagery wrenches open the text of the novel one line at a time to sublimate Yozo’s mental landscape into something even more delicate and grotesque. This is the ultimate in art by Itou, proof that nothing can surpass the terror of the human psyche.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Viz Media)",

          "description": "__Spouse:__ [Ishiguro Ayako (石黒亜矢子)](https://twitter.com/ishiguroayako)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/junjiitofficial)\n\n__Introduction:__\nJunji Itou is a Japanese writer, penciller, inker and mangaka, who is best known for his horror manga. Some of his notable works include [The Enigma of Amigara Fault](https://anilist.co/manga/112978/The-Enigma-of-Amigara-Fault/), [Tomie](https://anilist.co/manga/30912/Tomie/), [Uzumaki](https://anilist.co/manga/30436/Uzumaki-Spiral-into-Horror/), and [Gyo](https://anilist.co/manga/30909/Gyo/).\n\nHe was inspired from a young age by both his older sisters' drawings and the work of [Kazuo Umezu](https://anilist.co/staff/97777/Kazuo-Umezu). Itou first began writing and drawing manga as a hobby while working as a dental technician in the early 1990s. In 1987, he submitted a short story to Gekkan Halloween that won an honorable mention in the Kazuo Umezu Prize (with Umezu himself as one of the judges). This story was later serialized as Tomie.\n\nIn addition to [Kazuo Umezu](https://anilist.co/staff/97777/Kazuo-Umezu), Itou has cited [Hideshi Hino](https://anilist.co/staff/99735/Hideshi-Hino), [Shinichi Koga](https://anilist.co/staff/119971/Shinichi-Koga), [Yasutaka Tsutsui](https://anilist.co/staff/97488/Yasutaka-Tsutsui) and [H.P. Lovecraft](https://anilist.co/staff/101086/H-P-Lovecraft) as being major influences to his work. The universe Itou depicts is cruel and capricious, his characters often find themselves victims of malevolent unnatural circumstances for no discernible reason, or they are punished out of proportion for minor infractions against an unknown and incomprehensible natural order. Some of the recurring themes of Itou's work include body horror, seemingly ordinary characters who begin to act out of irrational compulsion, the breakdown of society, deep-sea organisms, and the inevitability of one's demise.\n\nFilm director Guillermo del Toro cited on his official Twitter account that Itou was originally a collaborator for the video game Silent Hills, of which both Del Toro and game designer [Hideo Kojima](https://anilist.co/staff/100732/Hideo-Kojima) were the main directors, however, a year after its announcement the project was canceled by [Konami](https://anilist.co/studio/85/Konami), the IP's owner. Itou and Del Toro would later lend their likenesses towards Kojima's next project, Death Stranding.\n\nIn 2006, Junji married Ishiguro Ayako, who is a picture book artist. As of 2013, they have two children. In 2019, Itou received an Eisner Award for his manga adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.",

A number of his most popular works, such as The Setting Sun (Shayō) and No Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku), are considered modern-day classics in Japan. With a semi-autobiographical style and transparency into his personal life, Dazai's stories have intrigued the minds of many readers. His influences include Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Murasaki Shikibu and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. While Dazai continues to be widely celebrated in Japan, he remains relatively unknown elsewhere with only a handful of his works available in English. His last book, No Longer Human, is his most popular work outside of Japan.\n\nOn June 13, 1948, Dazai and his mistress Tomie drowned themselves in the rain-swollen Tamagawa Canal, near his house. Their bodies were not discovered until six days later, on June 19, which would have been his 39th birthday. His grave is at the temple of Zenrin-ji, in Mitaka, Tokyo.",
