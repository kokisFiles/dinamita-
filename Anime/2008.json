          "description": "She got her start in the industry working as a part-time cel painter in the late ‘70s while studying at Nihon University. During this time she met [Yuuji Nunokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/117781/), who then invited her to join the establishment of [Studio Pierrot](https://anilist.co/studio/1/) in 1978.\n\nAt Pierrot she worked as an in-betweener on [Nils no Fushigi no Tabi](https://anilist.co/anime/2151/), the studio’s first show. After this she went freelance and soon gave up on her talent as an animator and turned into directing. She asked for guidance from [Kouichi Mashimo](https://anilist.co/staff/100094/), and made her debut as one of the two episode directors on the 29th episode of [Gold Lightan](https://anilist.co/anime/7106/) in 1981.\n\nShe continued her work storyboarding and directing episodes on shows such as [Dash Kappei](https://anilist.co/anime/2748/), [Miyuki](https://anilist.co/anime/2231/) and [Glass no Kamen](https://anilist.co/anime/506/). After this she made her series director debut with [Touch](https://anilist.co/anime/1065/) in 1985, a role which she was hand-picked for by [Gisaburou Sugii](https://anilist.co/staff/103537/), who served as the show’s chief director. They both reprised their roles for [Hiatari Ryoukou!](https://anilist.co/anime/729/) which took over the TV slot for Touch. After this Tokita directed [Yawara!](https://anilist.co/anime/691/), instead this time without an overseeing director.\n\nAfter having directed several more titles in the ‘90s, she switched her focus entirely to scriptwriting. As a writer she most famously worked on shows like [Tsukihime](https://anilist.co/anime/169/) and [School Rumble](https://anilist.co/anime/24/) before leaving the industry in 2009.",
