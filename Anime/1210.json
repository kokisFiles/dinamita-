  "description": "Satou’s life – or what’s left of it – is a paranoid mess of conspiracy theories and social anxieties. He’s terrified of the outside world; his apartment is overflowing with the remnants of cheap take-out food; and his retinas have been permanently scarred by a steady diet of internet porn. But maybe it’s not all his fault. After all, the nefarious N-H-K is out there, and they’re determined to turn society’s fringe-dwellers into a brainwashed lot of jobless, hopeless, futureless recluses.<br>\n<br>\nEnter Misaki – a mysterious girl-next-door type who is Satou’s last chance to beat down his inner demons and venture out into the light of day. She’s ready to help him overcome his crippling phobias, but Satou would rather cower in his existential foxhole and pretend to work on the demo for his virtual sex game.<br>\n<br>\nHe’s afraid to face the world. She’s strangely desperate to fix a total stranger. Maybe together they can be normal.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Funimation)",

          "description": "[Website](http://tatsuhikotakimoto.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tatsuhikotkmt) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TTTKMT)\n\nTatsuhiko Takimoto is a Japanese author, best known for Welcome to the NHK!, which began as a single novel that went on to be published by Kadokawa Shoten on January 28, 2002. The story was later adapted as a manga series in Shounen Ace. \n\nTakimoto wrote two afterwords in various editions of his novel. In the first afterword, dated December 2001, he stated that he was a hikikomori and was still recovering: \"... the themes addressed in this story are not things of the past for me but currently active problems.\" In a second Afterword, dated April 2005, Takimoto admitted that he had not written \"a single new story\" since N.H.K. and that he was \"reduced to a NEET, ... living as a parasite on the royalties from this book.\" He stated that he felt \"completely unable to write\" and \"incapacitated.\"\n\nIn 2016, a little over ten years after his last afterword, Takimoto created a blog post about \"Welcome to the NHK\", which could be considered a third afterward. Takimoto posted this to discuss his current feelings about his story: \"... I could not write what I wanted to write. I have been stuck for years in this sense of failure and frustration.\" Takimoto elaborates on the ending of “Welcome to the NHK”, explaining how he used the “rush” method to make the “... characters “run” to get into the climax. This led to Takimoto writing a story that left him discontented: “But I didn’t want a realistic story.” Instead, Takimoto wanted to create: \"... a story full of dreams and hope.\" Takimoto then proceeds to list off the methods that helped him escape from his Hikikomori lifestyle, and that if he applied himself better back then, maybe he could’ve written the story he wanted.\n\nTakimoto left a message to those in a situation similar to his: \"The most important thing is to know that you can change. Anyway, the path that leads to happiness exists. The key is, precisely, to trust in its existence.\" And with that being said, Takimoto was left with a sense of completion: \"This is what I wanted to write. This conviction that I have not expressed while working on 'Welcome to the NHK', I write it now. And, with this, my novel is finally complete.\"\n\n",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/松本憲生)\n\nOriginating from Tatsunoko's animators training institute, where he met [Atsushi Wakabayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/105805/). Though primarily an action animator, he’s demonstrated impressive range elsewhere like in his scenes for [Haibane Renmei](https://anilist.co/anime/387/) and [Kaguya-hime](https://anilist.co/anime/16664/). He has the reputation of a fast and disciplined worker. [Toshiyuki Inoue](https://anilist.co/staff/103724/) said that he must have a “secret” for producing such a large volume of superb cuts.\n\nThough one of his earliest assignments was as an in-betweens checker for [Akira](https://anilist.co/anime/47/), his first major job was on [Ranma ½](https://anilist.co/anime/210/), working under the director of the series, [Kazuhiro Furuhashi](https://anilist.co/staff/100655/). He would collaborate with Furuhashi again on Rurouni Kenshin, [You’re Under Arrest](https://anilist.co/anime/1577/), and [Hunter x Hunter](https://anilist.co/anime/136/). Around this time Matsumoto was also mentored by [Tomohiro Hirata](https://anilist.co/staff/122071/) on [Irresponsible Captain Tylor](https://anilist.co/anime/569/).\n\nMatsumoto’s character animation is loose and full of smears, often looking like featureless masses in individual frames. He draws smoke without highlights, a tendency that earned the nickname “Norio smoke” and has been imitated by animators like [Shingo Yamashita](https://anilist.co/staff/114914/) and [Kenichi Kutsuna](https://anilist.co/staff/116007/). He occasionally storyboards his own scenes as he did for the 12th episode of [Birdy Decode:02](https://anilist.co/anime/5074/), the [third Naruto movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2144/), and episodes 31 & 85 of [Rurouni Kenshin](https://anilist.co/anime/45/). Prefers battles that take place in wide-open spaces with lots of forward momentum and background movement. Influenced by [Satoru Utsunomiya](https://anilist.co/staff/101489/) and [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/), and has adapted elements of their approach for a wider audience.\n\nWhenever he serves as animation director on an episode, he does a lot of the key animation work himself. He also soloed the 7th episode of [Eat-Man](https://anilist.co/anime/1704/) and the [Kuragehime](https://anilist.co/anime/8129/) ED. He failed attempting to solo the 39th episode of You’re Under Arrest, and requested his name not be on the telop despite animating the vast majority of the episode.\n\nFamous for his work on the [Naruto](https://anilist.co/anime/20/) franchise, in which he often collaborated with Atsushi Wakabayashi.\n\nAs a well known animator with a wide network of connections, he regularly helps and receives help from his friends.\n\n(Source: Animators Wiki)",
