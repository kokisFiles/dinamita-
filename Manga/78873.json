  "description": "The series is set 150 years after humanity lost half of the planet due to a mysterious \"black fog.\" To contain the \"black fog,\" 3,000-meter-tall (about 10,000-feel-tall) walls were erected to split the world, and the half of the human population that survived now live in cities called \"Arks.\" <br><br>\nShidou Enishi, one of the few Japanese survivors, runs a detective agency on the ninth ark. While pursuing a male suspect in a burglary, he learns of a massive conspiracy, one that may be tied to the Rivigarudo syndrome that is mutating its victims into something inhuman.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ogata_kouji)\n\nBorn in 1970, a native of Osaka, Kouji Ogata spent his early twenties struggling to get enough credits to graduate from Osaka Design School. In late 1996, Ogata-sensei was commissioned by Media Works to illustrate the first Boogiepop novel, Boogiepop and Others.\n\nAt the time, Ogata-sensei was simply a rising star with a distinctive, eye-catching art style, but he was gradually able to further hone his artistic skills with each subsequent work. His watercolor-style paneling seen in the two-volume Boogiepop Doesn’t Laugh manga series was a particularly high point of his early career.\n\nIn addition to providing illustrations for novels and manga, Ogata-sensei has been involved with supplying character designs for anime productions including Boogiepop Phantom, Spirit, and Gin-iro no kami no Agito.\n\nIn his free time, he enjoys motorcycles, tennis, and remote-controlled models.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
