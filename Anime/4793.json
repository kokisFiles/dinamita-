          "description": "Ken Sugimori is a Japanese video game designer, illustrator, manga artist, and director. He is most famous as the character designer and art director for the Pokémon franchise. Sugimori is also credited with the art direction for other titles, including Pulseman.  \n\nSugimori drew all of the original 151 Pokémon himself. He has worked on the various Pokémon movies, trading cards, and other games like the Super Smash Bros. series. From early 1981 until 1986, Sugimori illustrated a gaming fanzine called Game Freak, which had been started by Satoshi Tajiri. Sugimori discovered the magazine in a doujinshi shop, and decided to get involved. Eventually, the two decided to pitch an arcade game design idea to Namco; they reworked Game Freak into a development company and produced Mendel Palace. \n\nSugimori is most famous as the character designer and art director for the Pokémon franchise. He has worked on the various Pokémon movies, trading cards, and other games. For Pokémon Black and White, Sugimori directed a team of 17 people in designing new characters for the games, though he always drew the final designs. He drew much of his inspiration from observing animals in aquariums and zoos. \n\nSugimori has also written and illustrated original manga, including one which was distributed with pre-orders of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness. When he begins a new character, his process normally involves making a rough sketch, then tracing it on to film paper while polishing it and making the illustration more professional looking. After that, he draws the character many times, changing its proportions until he is satisfied.",

At the studio he also met [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) and [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), with whom he later left in order to work at A Pro, and they began work on an adaptation of Pippi Longstocking. That project was eventually canceled, and work began on the two-film series [Panda! Go Panda!](https://anilist.co/anime/2611/).\n\nKotabe then worked as character designer on two highly influential series directed by Takahata: [Heidi, Girl of the Alps](https://anilist.co/anime/2225/), and [3000 Leagues in Search of Mother](https://anilist.co/anime/1663/). Miyazaki also took part working on scene design and layouts.\n\nIn 1985, he was scouted by Nintendo and assumed the position of the game development advisor. He worked at Nintendo for over two decades until leaving in 2007.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

It was only later that he joined the animation industry in 1964. He started quickly making a name for himself as a background artist and consequently established his own background art studio Kobayashi Production, in 1968. During this time thick poster paint was dominating the backgrounds in anime, but Kobayashi started a new style with much thinner painting and colored pencil strokes.\n\nHe has worked as an art director on over 100 titles and is one of the most distinguished art directors in the medium. Notable works include [Gamba no Bouken](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/), [Ie Naki Ko](https://anilist.co/anime/2828/), [Takarajima](https://anilist.co/anime/2618/), [Tenshi no Tamago](https://anilist.co/anime/885/), [Utena](https://anilist.co/anime/440/), [Berserk](https://anilist.co/anime/33/) and [Nodame Cantabile](https://anilist.co/anime/1698/).\n\nKobayashi retired from the industry in 2010, which was followed by his studio's closedown a year later.\n\nIn a 2015 [interview](https://youtu.be/V1tiKOsCz2M), Kobayashi talked about his life and passion in painting touring his atelier and showcasing his work.",
