  "description": "Whether it be owning a pet pony, becoming a princess, or marrying Tom Cruise, every young girl has one dream or another. Dorothy, who&rsquo;s just a regular middle school girl, has a drastic change in her dreams when one day she runs into Mistress Lilly, an accomplished witch who is looking for an apprentice. Sure, some girls would want to become a witch so that they could learn to make love potions, or own magical cats and rabbits that talk&hellip; but where&rsquo;s the fun in that? Our cute heroine would answer this question by replying : &ldquo;I&rsquo;d want to become a witch to live out a romantic life that every girl wishes for&hellip; you know, like turning the world into a dark hellish cauldron, making everyone bow to me, and summoning cute zombies, tee hee hee~!&rdquo;<br><br>\nOh yes, and what kind of comedy would this be without having all the hyperactive crazy sub-characters that make the heroine seem like a senile old lady in comparison. First, you have Dorothy&rsquo;s close friend Remi who doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand you&rsquo;re only supposed to take just 1 prozac pill a day. Then you have Lilly, the witch, who&rsquo;s fashion sense would make Madonna and Britney Spears blush. And finally, we can&rsquo;t forget about Dorothy&rsquo;s main love interest, a cute boy who&rsquo;s only problem is that he&rsquo;s a werewolf who wants to eat her alive! <br><br>\n(Source: Infinity Studios)",
