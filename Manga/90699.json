          "description": "__Hometown:__ Nyuzen, Toyama Prefecture, Japan\n\nIkehara is a manga artist. In junior high school, he was moved by Osamu Tezuka's \"Astro Boy\" and started drawing manga. After joining Shōnen Gahōsha, where he worked as a sales representative for two months, he joined Tezuka Productions in 1970 at a friend's invitation, and worked as an assistant to Osamu Tezuka for a year and a half. Later, at Tezuka Productions, he was also involved in animation production as an assistant storyboard artist for \"Triton of the Sea\" and \"Marvelous Melmo.\" At that time, he learned how to draw storyboards from Yoshiyuki Tomino. In the early 1970s, he joined Hiromi Productions, a group of planners established by Tezuka's assistants and other related people, and was involved in the planning of TV anime such as \"Miracle Girl Limit-chan\" and \"Majokko Megu-chan.\"\n\nSince then, he has written for such magazines as \"Bōken-Ō\" and \"Comic BomBom.\" He mainly draws manga adaptations of TV shows such as robot anime, and video game related works. The mascot bomb character of Comic BomBom was designed by him.",
