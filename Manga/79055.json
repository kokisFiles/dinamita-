          "description": "__Keiji Nakazawa__ was a mangaka, scriptwriter and animation producer. \n\nNakazawa was born March 14, 1939 in Hiroshima, Japan. At the age of 6, he survived the 1945 Hiroshima bombing and the loss of most of his immediate family — his father, older sister, younger brother, and younger sister. Only he, his mother, and two brothers who were not at home survived.\n\nAfter graduating from middle school in 1954, he moved to Tokyo in 1961 and became a published manga creator at the age of 24 in 1963. He created several titles such as Kuroi Ame ni Utarete (Drenched by Black Rain) after the passing of his mother in 1966, before drawing his most famous work from 1973 to 1985. The resulting ten volumes of Barefoot Gen have since sold over 6.5 millon copies and have been translated in over 10 languages, including English, Russian, and Korean.\n\nNakazawa had undergone treatment for lung cancer and related ailments in 2010 and 2011. He had abandoned plans for a new Barefoot Gen sequel in 2009 due to his worsening eyesight from a cataract and a damaged retina. However, he said, \"Our generation must continue to tell of the horrors of atomic bombs and war.\" \n\nNakazawa passed away on December 19, 2012 at a Hiroshima hospital due to lung cancer. He was 73.",
