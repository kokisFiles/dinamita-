  "description": "Ayato Kamina was separated from the girl he loved, Haruka Mishima, when an event occurred that was thought to have killed everyone outside of Tokyo. But one day three years later, invaders suddenly attacked the city. It was then that he meets an agent of TERRA, Haruka Shitow, who tells him that she will give him the truth about the world. It is the beginning of a series of strange events, which involve him activating a giant mecha, the RahXephon and finding out that many people, including his own mother, has blue blood, and that he was actually living in a self-encased dimension where time moves slower than that of the outside world.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "Kanno's earliest experiences with music came from attending church with her parents. She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

          "description": "A notable mechanical and character designer for both anime and tokusatsu series.\n\nHe aspired a career in the industry after having seen [Space Battleship Yamato](https://anilist.co/anime/1650/), a franchise in which he would eventually serve as a director [in 2012](https://anilist.co/anime/12029/). His career began in 1978, debuting as a mechanical designer on [Toushou Daimos](https://anilist.co/anime/2816/), designing the enemy robots. Few years later in 1981, he made his tokusatsu debut on Robot 8-chan.\n\nThe following decade he worked on industry shaping series such as [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/86/), [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/) and [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/). During this time he also had ties to Parallel Creation, a creative group led by sci-fi writer [Aritsune Toyota](https://anilist.co/staff/220367/). This led him to work as an illustrator on novels such as [Record of Lodoss War](https://anilist.co/manga/92655/), in which his designs were deeply influential for Japanese fantasy series.\n\nIn 2002, he directed [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), an anime original created by him. Izubuchi said that his attempt was to set a new standard for mecha anime, as well as to bring back aspects of '70s mecha shows like [Brave Raideen](https://anilist.co/anime/2128/).\n\nA trademark in his mechanical designs is the Buchi-hole (ブチ穴), a series of round holes embedded, usually in a cluster pattern of three holes above and two below, located somewhere on the mecha.",

He is also known to be the creator of Ultraman Gaia, as cited by Tsuburaya Productions.\n\nKonaka's serious works generally have a dark, psychological tone. As a Cthulhu Mythos writer, he tends to add Lovecraftian elements to his works.\n\n\"Chiaki J. Konaka\" is a very unusual name, as Japanese names typically do not include middle names. Konaka states that the \"J.\" evokes the \"Christian\" name \"John\", due to him being born to parents who were members of the Anglican Church, but he does not identify as Christian. He began using the \"J.\" at the age of 12, when he began making 8 mm films; he patterned the style after Western names such as \"Charles M. Schulz\".\n\nHe has cited [Ghost Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/2596/) as his favorite screenwriting project.",

He went independent after leaving the studio in 1991. As a freelancer he worked on numerous works as a key animator and started quickly getting recognized as one of the strongest action animators in the industry.\n\nIn 2000, Andou made his debut as an episode director with [Medarot](https://anilist.co/anime/1138/)'s 49th episode, and started gradually shifting his focus from animating to directing and storyboarding episodes himself. He mainly worked on studio [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/)' productions in the early '00s, and got to direct several episodes of [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), [Wolf's Rain](https://anilist.co/anime/202/) and [Fullmetal Alchemist](https://anilist.co/anime/121/). In 2007, he directed [Sword of the Stranger](https://anilist.co/anime/2418/), a film which was also produced by Bones. He has since directed multiple shows for both Bones and [P.A. Works](https://anilist.co/studio/132/).\n\nNoted for his action storyboards. He is also close friends with [Masahiro Satou](https://anilist.co/staff/134126/) and often works with him.\n\n_Note: Not to be confused with older animator [Masahiro Andou](https://anilist.co/staff/155926/)._",
