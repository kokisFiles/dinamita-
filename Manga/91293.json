  "description": "The novel will tell two original stories focusing on the feelings of Tamako and Midori, as well as Choi's heart that is in love as she searches for a bride for the prince on the southern island. Certain elements written in the novel will not be animated in the film.\nTamako and Midori's story takes place in the girls' third year of high school. Although everyone is thinking about their careers, Tamako's head is filled with thoughts of mochi. On the other hand, Mochizou has decided to go to a college in Tokyo. Midori watches the two, but has worries of her own.\nIn Choi's story, she continues to urgently search for a bride for the prince. She works together with Dera, who has fattened up like a ball, to use fortune-telling to find the prince's future bride, but with no luck. However, one day, the two find a certain document when they go to the country's library to look for hints on fortune-telling.<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dochibibi)\n\n<b>Yukiko Horiguchi</b> is an animator, illustrator and character designer formerly belonging to Kyoto Animation.\n\nShe joined Kyoto Animation in 2003 after graduating from a junior college (tanki daigaku). She started as inbetweener on Shin-Chan, before making a debut as key animator on the KyoAni in-house OVA Munto. In 2007 she was given the chance to design characters for the anime adaptation of the Lucky Star yon-koma manga.\n\nHoriguchi is particularly known for the shape she gives her drawings, resulting in a certain roundness and the distinctly fine outline and peculiar shading. Her characters appear to be very child-like and cute, and full of energy, which is a major appeal to the fans.\n\nThe illustrator [BUNBUN](https://anilist.co/staff/112785) is her younger brother.",
