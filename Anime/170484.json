          "description": "__Languages:__ Japanese and English\n__Company:__ Crypton Future Media\n__Release Date:__ December 27, 2007\n__Favorite Food:__ Bananas\n\n__Len Kagamine__, codenamed CV02, is Japanese VOCALOIDs developed and distributed by Crypton Future Media, Inc., and were initially released in December 2007 for the VOCALOID2 engine. He (along with his counterpart, Rin) is the second set of vocals for Crypton's Character Vocal Series and are both Character Voice VOCALOIDs. During their Append's production, Wataru Sasaki (aka. Wat) described Rin & Len as two bodies with one soul. \nHe has had numerous installments since such as additional voice banks dubbed 'Append', an update to the VOCALOID4 engine, and an English vocal. \n\nWhen the Kagamines were being recorded in 2007, their names were not yet decided. Their given names of Rin and Len were said to be based on \"right\" and \"left\" according to Asami Shimoda. She later confirmed in an interview after the Append release that the names were based on Ken and Rin from Hokuto no Ken, derived from a discussion about names that were familiar from her childhood.\nTheir surname was derived from the developing code combining Kagami (鏡, mirror) and Ne (音, sound). This refers to an \"echo\", which is a sound being bounced back to the user from a different direction caused by sound waves hitting a surface in a direction that reflects it back the way it came.\n\nTheir codename of \"CV02\" means \"Character Voice 02\".\n\nTheir voices are provided by the Japanese voice actress, stage actress, and singer [Asami Shimoda](https://anilist.co/staff/96696).\n\nVoicebanks:\n~!Power (V2 & V4)\nCold (V2 & V4)\nSerious (V2 & V4)\nEnglish (V4)!~",
