          "description": "__Doujin Circles:__ Igyou Nami Club (異形波倶楽部), Mandaruma (まんだるま)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/uzigawaita)\n\nUziga Waita, normally operates under the circle Uzigaya. Uziga Waita is the penname used for all adult materials he makes. He is most known for his prolific career producing snuff, guro, and ryona works, as well as peppering with torture, and just about any other gruesome and dark tag you can think of. He tends to toss in lot's of black humor as well, which offsets his gruesome work. Uziga is still active today, producing doujins featuring popular series, of course using his typical style.\n\nHis homepage contains many of his works and a content warning in the first page. In Japanese, the phrase \"Uji ga waita\" (蛆が湧いた) means \"the maggots have gushed forth\", although this would be written with different kanji than those he uses for his name.",
