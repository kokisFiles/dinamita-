  "description": "She's an archeologist AND a black belt and Ray Kazuki will need her brains and her brawn as she plunges into a thrill-filled adventure. Ray's examining an exciting new archeological discovery: a legendary temple located in an isolated area of the world. <br><br>\nAs always, she has with her a strange mirror that belonged to her father; a mirror that may provide access to a vanished civilization. On the excavation, Ray meets Mai and Mami Tachibana, freewheeling pubescent girls who heedlessly court danger. And danger they find, in the form of Rig Veda. <br><br>\nVeda's after a big prize: Ray's mirror. But she will have to stop him at all costs, because if Veda gets his hands on the powerful object, he will possess secrets that could lead to disaster.",

He soon stopped showing up at Telecom because of all the in-betweening work he was given, and was thus fired.

He then gave up on being an animator and started working part-time jobs while trying to get a manga serialization.

He made his initial splash in [Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket](https://anilist.co/anime/82/), and continued to develop his approach to animation which he calls \"full limited,\" which eliminated the pose-to-pose feel of conventional keyframe animation. His characteristic animation can be seen in [Ghost in the Shell](https://anilist.co/anime/43/) and [End of Evangelion](https://anilist.co/anime/32/).\n\nIn [Blood: The Last Vampire](https://anilist.co/anime/405/), Iso experimented with digital processing of his hand-drawn fire effects, elevating it to uncanny realism. Iso then got his first taste of directing in [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/) episode 15, which he largely animated and also digitally processed himself.\n\nHis animation sensibilities, process innovations, experience in multiple levels of anime production, and interest in technology culminated in the 2007 sci-fi series, [Dennou Coil](https://anilist.co/anime/2164/), his veritable brainchild. During its production, there was a rumored falling-out with key staff. For the next several years, Iso would quietly animate under the pseudonym Mikio Odagawa.\n\nTook part as a key animator on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2018, he announced his retirement as an animator to focus exclusively on directing.",
