  "description": "The Dezalg have returned with a new, horrible weapon and unleashed it on Megazone 23's defences. Believing their salvation is also in new weapons, B.D. is still bent on breaking EVE's final protection level. Full control of Megazone 23 would mean unfettered weapons development.\n\nShogo, meanwhile, has tried to return to a normal life — hanging out with his biker gang, Trash and his girlfriend, Yui. But, his convictions about the Megazone's shadow government policies have not changed and when EVE calls for his help, he discovers where the Garland bike has been hidden.\n\nIt is showdown time for Shogo and B.D., Trash and the military, as well as the Dezalg and Megazone. However, EVE's final secret, A.D.A.M., may mean no one will survive.",

One of his first representative works was an independently produced animation titled \"Moonstruck Artemis,\" that he made while part of a manga club during his university days. Aramaki didn't have a special desire to work in the animation industry, but has stated joining it solely because he could draw and the industry had a wide range of options for someone like that. He has also said that the spread of digital technology has made it easier for him to work in both anime and live-action.\n\nIn 2004, Aramaki directed [Appleseed](https://anilist.co/anime/54/), a re-interpretation of a [Shirou Masamune](https://anilist.co/staff/97609/) manga by [the same name](https://anilist.co/manga/30668/). Although bashed by critics, the movie was an influential piece in the medium that had great impact on creators around the world. Studio Ghibli co-founder [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) said the movie would reform the industry.",

After a colleague had pointed this out it started bothering him and he went through great effort to gradually establish his own unique visual style which he is known for today.
