          "description": "[Website](https://www.annie-west.com/)\n\nAnnie spent her formative years on the east coast of Australia. Her family encouraged a love of books, the bush and travel, and she often managed to combine all three. There was the long trek to the marvellous Finders Ranges of South Australia - with Tolkien. Walking in the rugged Grampian Ranges of Victoria - with Tolstoy. And reading gothic romances while camped under the snow gums in the Australian Alps. Her chance to write came when she took leave from her job to spend time with her children. Between preschool and school activities she produced her first novel. At the same time she discovered Romance Writers of Australia. Annie lives with her husband and children at Lake Macquarie, north of Sydney.\n",
