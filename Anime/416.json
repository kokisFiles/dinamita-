  "description": "Take flight with \"Porco\" Rosso, a valiant World War I flying ace! From tropical Adriatic settings to dazzling aerial maneuvers, this action-adventure from world-renowned animator Hayao Miyazaki is full of humor, courage and chivalry. When \"Porco\" &mdash;whose face has been transformed into that of a pig by a mysterious spell&mdash; infuriates a band of sky pirates with his aerial heroics, the pirates hire Curtis, a rival pilot, to \"get rid\" of him. On the ground, the two pilots compete for the affections of the beautiful Gina. But it is in the air where the true battles are waged. Will our hero be victorious? <br><br>\n(Source: Disney) ",

He was expected to become one of the top directors at Studio Ghibli, alongside [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) and [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), and to become their eventual successor.\n\nKondou entered Niigata Prefectural Muramatsu High School in April, 1965, where he was a member of the art club. In the school, one of his seniors was the future manga artist [Kimio Yanagisawa](https://anilist.co/staff/100609/). In April, 1968, he moved to Tokyo after graduating from high school, where he entered Tokyo Design College's animation department. In October, 1968, he began working at [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/), then A Production. There he took part in the production of shows like [Kyojin no Hoshi](https://anilist.co/anime/5834/) and [Lupin III](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/). In 1978, Kondou moved to [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/), where he worked on shows such as [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) and [Anne of Green Gables](https://anilist.co/anime/283/), making his proper character designing debut in the latter.\n\nIn December 1980, Kondou moved to [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), where he served as the character designer for [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/). Kondou resigned from his position at Telecom in March of 1985, and was hospitalized from June through August for a type of pneumonia. He became a contract worker for Nippon Animation afterwards and moved to Studio Ghibli in January, 1987.\n\nIn 1995, he made his directorial debut with the renown Studio Ghibli film, Whisper of the Heart.\n\nKondou suddenly passed away from an aortic dissection on January 21, 1998, which according to doctors had been brought on by overwork. Kondou’s death is also believed to be the reason for Miyazaki’s initial announcement of retirement.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She has since then been one of the lead animators in almost every single Ghibli film.\n\nFor her first job she drew the scene of Nausicaä listening to Yupa in Jiru's room, and also Nausicaä trying to save the old men in barge, and Nausicaä pushing the gunship to its limit near the end. In [Kiki](https://anilist.co/anime/512/) she drew over 50 shots of Kiki and Ursula at the log house. In [Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/) she drew the scene where the wolf is rescued from under the boars. In [Whisper of the Heart](https://anilist.co/anime/585/) she drew the scene that takes place in the rain. In [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/), she wanted to participate more as an animator, but was told to help out animation director [Masashi Andou](https://anilist.co/staff/106978/) after only having drawn a little animation, namely the scene at the beginning where Sen walks out of the tunnel. In [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/) she was able to come back full force as an animator. In films since then she has occasionally taken part as an animation director, but mostly as an animator.\n\n(Source: [Pelleas](http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/title_34))",

Miyazaki has stated, \"If it were not for Mr. Suzuki, there wouldn't have been Studio Ghibli.\" Ghibli co-founder [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), has acknowledged the pivotal role of Suzuki in bringing the Nausicaä manga series into the world and used nearly identical words as Miyazaki to acknowledge Suzuki’s essential role in the creation of Studio Ghibli. Takahata also credits Suzuki for his steadfast support of Miyazaki and has cited Suzuki’s responsibility for making his friendship with Miyazaki endure.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

This precept is still respected today and it's one of the reasons Japanese animation is so distinctly unique. His career is also a testament to his ethos that expressive and vibrant animation is not achieved simply through increasing the number of frames but through playing with movement, poses and timing.\n\nIn the early '00s, Kanada became an employee at Square Enix.\n\nNotable Square Enix titles in which he was credited:\n\n~!\n- 2002, Final Fantasy XI (Motion Capture, Animation Director)\n- 2005, Musashiden II: Blade Master (Storyboard)\n- 2006, Dawn of Mana (Facial Setting)\n- 2007, Final Fantasy 4 DS Version (Storyboard)\n- 2009, Final Fantasy XIII (Storyboard Director) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2011, Final Fantasy XIII-2 (Storyboard) - *Posthumous credit.*\n- 2012, Dragon Quest X (Storyboard)  - *Posthumous credit.* !~",

          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/大塚伸治)\n\nThe epitome of the versatile animator capable of adapting to any anime to do outstanding work in that style. Ootsuka's animation is professional but always full of personality and a special verve. \n\nHe is one of the pillars of [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/)'s animation. Not confined to the Ghibli style, he has always searched for new means of expression, having done everything from the photorealistic to the cartoonish. The wonderful feeling of weight in the movement of Toshio running around the train station in [Only Yesterday](https://anilist.co/anime/1029/), the delightful bodyguards in [The Cat Returns](https://anilist.co/anime/597/), the little robot coming out of the water in the final episode of [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/) - all of these are quintessential Ootsuka. \n\nNone other than the animation director of [Tokyo Godfathers](https://anilist.co/anime/759/) has conceded that the film was originally conceived as a project to showcase Ootsuka's talents, in the same way [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/) was a vehicle for [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/). Most of Ootsuka's scenes in the film were drawn entirely by himself, with no in-betweens, and his cuts which were the first finished, had a determining influence on the direction of the animation by the rest of the animators. \n\n(Source: [Pelleas](http://www.pelleas.net/animators/#20))",

          "description": "__Residency:__ Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan\n__Graduated:__ Gakushuin University (Department of Economics)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, script/screenwriter, author, mangaka and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He is the second of four brothers, and was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyou Ward. He is best known for his international fame as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of astonishing animated feature films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\n\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014, as well as having won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature, the only instances in which a non-English-language film has won the award. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n__Biography:__\nMiyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, which led to him eventually joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation) in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with the director [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/Isao-Takahata). Some notable films Miyazaki contributed to at Toei include [Doggie March](https://anilist.co/anime/9228/Wan-Wan-Chuushingura/) and [Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/2833/Gullivers-Travels-Beyond-the-Moon/). He provided key animation in other films at Toei, such as the Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to animation studio A-Pro in 1971, where he would co-direct the movie Lupin the Third Part I alongside Isao Takahata. After moving to Zuiyou Eizou (later dubbed [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/Nippon-Animation)) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/Future-Boy-Conan/). He joined [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/Telecom-Animation-Film)/Tokyo Movie Shinsa in 1979 to direct his first feature films, [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/) in 1979 and [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/) in 1984, as well as the television series [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/Sherlock-Hound/).\n\nMiyazaki co-founded [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/Studio-Ghibli) in 1985. He would go on to direct numerous of films with Ghibli, including [Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/Castle-in-the-Sky/) (1986), [My Neighbor Totoro](https://anilist.co/anime/523/My-Neighbor-Totoro/) (1988), [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/Kikis-Delivery-Service/) (1989), and [Porco Rosso](https://anilist.co/anime/416/Porco-Rosso/) (1992). The films they made were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. His film [Princess Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/Princess-Mononoke/) was the first animated film to ever win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and it briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997, and its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Studio Ghibli's popularity and influence outside of Japan. His 2001 film [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/Spirited-Away/) became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films, [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/) (2004), [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/Ponyo/) (2008), and [The Wind Rises](https://anilist.co/anime/16662/The-Wind-Rises/) (2013) also enjoyed critical and commercial success.\n\nFollowing the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned again in 2016 to work on a new feature film, [The Boy and The Heron](https://anilist.co/anime/109979/The-Boy-and-the-Heron/) (2023). The film received critical acclaim, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and the second non-English-language film, after Spirited Away, to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards. According to Studio Ghibli vice-president [Junichi Nishioka](https://anilist.co/staff/212700/Junichi-Nishioka) and long-time colleague, [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/Toshio-Suzuki), Miyazaki is reportedly working on another feature film, contrary to rumours that The Boy and the Heron would be his last.",
