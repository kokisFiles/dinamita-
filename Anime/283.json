  "description": "Anne is an orphan full of imagination. When she arrives at her new home she learns that sometimes you have to be a sensible person too; at the same time her unique character changes, or at least attracts, the people around her. The story covers Anne's growth from about eleven to seventeen years old as she makes friends, goes to school and studies. At a difficult point in her life, Anne will have to make a hard choice and perhaps find a new dream.",

The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 500 short stories and poems. Because many of the novels were set on Prince Edward Island, Canada and the Canadian province became literary landmarks. She was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935.",

          "description": "__Residency:__ Tokorozawa City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan\n__Graduated:__ Gakushuin University (Department of Economics)\n\n__Introduction:__\nHayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, director, script/screenwriter, author, mangaka and co-founder of Studio Ghibli. He is the second of four brothers, and was born in the town of Akebono-cho, part of Tokyo's Bunkyou Ward. He is best known for his international fame as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of astonishing animated feature films, and he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.\n\nMiyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014, as well as having won two Oscars for Best Animated Feature, the only instances in which a non-English-language film has won the award. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.\n\n__Biography:__\nMiyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, which led to him eventually joining [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/Toei-Animation) in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with the director [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/Isao-Takahata). Some notable films Miyazaki contributed to at Toei include [Doggie March](https://anilist.co/anime/9228/Wan-Wan-Chuushingura/) and [Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon](https://anilist.co/anime/2833/Gullivers-Travels-Beyond-the-Moon/). He provided key animation in other films at Toei, such as the Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to animation studio A-Pro in 1971, where he would co-direct the movie Lupin the Third Part I alongside Isao Takahata. After moving to Zuiyou Eizou (later dubbed [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/Nippon-Animation)) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/Future-Boy-Conan/). He joined [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/Telecom-Animation-Film)/Tokyo Movie Shinsa in 1979 to direct his first feature films, [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/Lupin-The-3rd-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/) in 1979 and [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/anime/572/Nausica-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/) in 1984, as well as the television series [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/Sherlock-Hound/).\n\nMiyazaki co-founded [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/Studio-Ghibli) in 1985. He would go on to direct numerous of films with Ghibli, including [Castle in the Sky](https://anilist.co/anime/513/Castle-in-the-Sky/) (1986), [My Neighbor Totoro](https://anilist.co/anime/523/My-Neighbor-Totoro/) (1988), [Kiki's Delivery Service](https://anilist.co/anime/512/Kikis-Delivery-Service/) (1989), and [Porco Rosso](https://anilist.co/anime/416/Porco-Rosso/) (1992). The films they made were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. His film [Princess Mononoke](https://anilist.co/anime/164/Princess-Mononoke/) was the first animated film to ever win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and it briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997, and its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Studio Ghibli's popularity and influence outside of Japan. His 2001 film [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/Spirited-Away/) became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films, [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/Howls-Moving-Castle/) (2004), [Ponyo](https://anilist.co/anime/2890/Ponyo/) (2008), and [The Wind Rises](https://anilist.co/anime/16662/The-Wind-Rises/) (2013) also enjoyed critical and commercial success.\n\nFollowing the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned again in 2016 to work on a new feature film, [The Boy and The Heron](https://anilist.co/anime/109979/The-Boy-and-the-Heron/) (2023). The film received critical acclaim, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and the second non-English-language film, after Spirited Away, to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 96th Academy Awards. According to Studio Ghibli vice-president [Junichi Nishioka](https://anilist.co/staff/212700/Junichi-Nishioka) and long-time colleague, [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/Toshio-Suzuki), Miyazaki is reportedly working on another feature film, contrary to rumours that The Boy and the Heron would be his last.",

          "description": "Yoshifumi Kondou was a Japanese animator who worked for [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/) in his last years, and was most known for directing the film [Whisper of the Heart](https://anilist.co/anime/585/). He was expected to become one of the top directors at Studio Ghibli, alongside [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) and [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), and to become their eventual successor.\n\nKondou entered Niigata Prefectural Muramatsu High School in April, 1965, where he was a member of the art club. In the school, one of his seniors was the future manga artist [Kimio Yanagisawa](https://anilist.co/staff/100609/). In April, 1968, he moved to Tokyo after graduating from high school, where he entered Tokyo Design College's animation department. In October, 1968, he began working at [Shin-Ei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/247/), then A Production. There he took part in the production of shows like [Kyojin no Hoshi](https://anilist.co/anime/5834/) and [Lupin III](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/). In 1978, Kondou moved to [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/), where he worked on shows such as [Future Boy Conan](https://anilist.co/anime/302/) and [Anne of Green Gables](https://anilist.co/anime/283/), making his proper character designing debut in the latter.\n\nIn December 1980, Kondou moved to [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/), where he served as the character designer for [Sherlock Hound](https://anilist.co/anime/1972/). Kondou resigned from his position at Telecom in March of 1985, and was hospitalized from June through August for a type of pneumonia. He became a contract worker for Nippon Animation afterwards and moved to Studio Ghibli in January, 1987.\n\nIn 1995, he made his directorial debut with the renown Studio Ghibli film, Whisper of the Heart.\n\nKondou suddenly passed away from an aortic dissection on January 21, 1998, which according to doctors had been brought on by overwork. Kondou’s death is also believed to be the reason for Miyazaki’s initial announcement of retirement.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Isao Takahata was a Japanese director, screenwriter, producer and one of the founders of [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/). Takahata earned international critical acclaim for his work as a director of anime films such as, [Grave of the Fireflies](https://anilist.co/anime/578/), [Only Yesterday](https://anilist.co/anime/1029/), [Pom Poko](https://anilist.co/anime/1030/), [My Neighbors the Yamadas](https://anilist.co/anime/415/) and [The Tale of the Princess Kaguya](https://anilist.co/anime/16664/).\n\nTakahata graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1959 with a degree in French literature. Around this time he had seen the French film The King and the Mockingbird, which led him to become interested in animation as a medium. A friend suggested for him to apply for a directing job at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/); Takahata passed their entrance exam, and was hired as an assistant director for several of Toei's works, including [Wolf Boy Ken](https://anilist.co/anime/17521/), on which he was mentored by [Yasuo Ootsuka](https://anilist.co/staff/136873/). Ootsuka eventually asked Takahata to direct a film of his own, thus he made his directorial debut in 1968 with the film [The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun](https://anilist.co/anime/1044/). A Toei employee named [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) served as a key animator in the film. Though it would later be recognized as one of the first defining works of modern Japanese animation, the film was a commercial failure, and Takahata was demoted.\n\nUnable to further improve his standing at Toei, Takahata left the studio in 1971, along with Miyazaki and [Youichi Kotabe](https://anilist.co/staff/115532/). Takahata and Miyazaki came up with the idea of creating an animated feature film based on the stories of Pippi Longstocking, and the duo had developed a number of storyboards and had flown out to Sweden for location shots and to meet with the books' author, [Astrid Lindgren](https://anilist.co/staff/140833/), and secure the rights for the character. However, they could not reach an agreement and were forced to drop the project. Takahata and Miyazaki remained collaborators in several other animation projects through the 1970s, including taking over production of the anime series [Lupin the Third](https://anilist.co/anime/1412/). \n\nNot long afterwards, Takahata, Kotabe, and Miyazaki were approached by the studio Zuiyo to create an animated series based on the novel Heidi, which resulted in [Heidi, Girl of the Alps](https://anilist.co/anime/2225/). Zuiyo later became [Nippon Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/22/), which Takahata and Miyazaki joined. Takahata's work there included a World Masterpiece Theater adaptation of [Anne of Green Gables](https://anilist.co/anime/283/). Nearly a decade later around 1981, Takahata left Nippon to join [Telecom Animation Film](https://anilist.co/studio/94/).\n\nConcurrent to these events, Miyazaki had made his own directorial debut in the Lupin III feature film [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/) in 1979, which was a critical success. Inspired by this, Miyazaki then began developing his own manga, [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://anilist.co/manga/30651/), and directing its 1984 [film adaption](https://anilist.co/anime/572/), which also was commercially and critically successful. Miyazaki then approached Takahata with the idea of co-founding their own animation studio based on the success of Nausicaä. And thus, Studio Ghibli was formed in 1985 by Miyazaki, Takahata, and Miyazaki's collaborators [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/) and [Yasuyoshi Tokuma](https://anilist.co/staff/157040/).\n\nThe studio primarily released animated feature films that were directed by Miyazaki, with Takahata serving as producer or in other roles. Takahata also directed several Studio Ghibli films himself. His first, Grave of the Fireflies, released in 1988, was based on the semi-autobiographical short story of the same name written by Akiyuki Nosaka. Takahata was also partially inspired by his own experiences from the bombing of Okayama City, which he and his family had survived through back in 1945. The film received critical acclaim for its emotional impact and anti-war themes and is considered the film that established the international esteem of Studio Ghibli. Takahata went on to direct four more Ghibli films throughout his career. He was nominated for an Oscar in the category of Best Animated Feature Film at the 87th Academy Awards for The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.\n\nTakahata had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and died on April 5, 2018, at a hospital in Tokyo, at the age of 82. On May 15, 2018, a farewell ceremony for Takahata was held at the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. Hayao Miyazaki publicly spoke for the first time about Takahata's death, saying \"I was convinced that Paku-san [Takahata's nickname] would live to be 95 years old, but he unfortunately passed away. It makes me think my time is also limited... Thank you, Paku-san.\"\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
