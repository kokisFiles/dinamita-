          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/k_tsuruta_info)\n\nDuring his formative years in university as a student of optical science, Tsuruta, who had initially wanted to be a photographer, had been inspired by the works of numerous science fiction authors, such as Robert A. Heinlein, and manga artists, such as Yukinobu Hoshino and his manga Saber Tiger, which had inspired him to create manga. He has also cited Tetsuya Chiba and his manga among his inspirations.\n\nSoon after graduating, he wrote numerous dōjinshi and was an assistant to numerous manga artists, prior to making his debut as a professional manga artist. In 1986, Tsuruta made his professional debut, authoring his first manga series, the short work, Hiroku te suteki na uchū ja nai ka (広くてすてきな宇宙じゃないか?, a.k.a. What a Big Wonderful Universe It Is), which was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Morning seinen magazine, set in a world where the land was sinking into water. Tsuruta has cited that the inspiration to this debut work of his came during a train journey from Tokyo to the ocean at Odawara, during which he had seen numerous rice paddies and thought of the possibility of a train line passing through the ocean, after which he wanted to create a work where he could use this image.\n\nSoon after, Tsuruta authored Spirit of Wonder, among his most famous works, in which he applied many of his inspirations, which was serialized in Kodansha's seinen magazines Weekly Morning and Afternoon between 1987 and 1996, and was later adapted into an anime series.\n\nAfter Spirit of Wonder, Tsuruta wrote short manga works, and also illustrated numerous art books, which were quite successful. In 2002, he provided the character designs for the anime series Abenobashi Mahō Shōtengai and also authored its manga adaptation.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, Tsuruta received the 31st and 32nd Seiun Awards for outstanding artist of the year. He has also received the Hayakawa Award for best illustrator, in 2000.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ogura_koubou)\n\nIn 1977, Ogura joined *Kobayashi Production* and learned the ropes of art direction under [Shichirou Kobayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/103964/Shichirou-Kobayashi). In 1983 he left and established Studio Fuga together with Kouji Oono and [Toshiharu Mizutani](https://anilist.co/staff/121908/Toshiharu-Mizutani). There he eventually left as well and formed his own 'Ogura Kobo' at Production I.G., where he trains newer art directors. He continues to be a major presence at Production I.G. as one of their most prominent art directors.\n\nOgura's style is, similar to Kobayashi's, rooted in imposing architecture, ambient colors, and Western perspectives versus traditional Japanese isometric perspectives. Ogura's backgrounds are usually urban in setting and has a less saturated color palette, and uses more cool than warm colors. Ogura's fantastical, European Kobayashi influence is easily seen in [Wings of Honneamise](https://anilist.co/anime/1034/Ouritsu-Uchuugun-Honneamise-no-Tsubasa/), and his later work has remained distinctly metropolitan, something that can be seen even in the rural [FLCL](https://anilist.co/anime/227/FLCL/).\n",

In 1981, when she was in her third university year, she learned that Toei Douga was recruiting new employees and took an exam to become a trainee director. The studio's policy at the time was not to employ women as directors, and although she scored top marks in the exam, she was encouraged to try writing screenplays instead. She made her debut with a script for episode 42 of Dr. Slump: Arale-chan, which was aired on 10 February 1982. After that, she established a successful career in scriptwriting. On 15 December 2017, she passed away at age 58 from an undisclosed disease.\n",
