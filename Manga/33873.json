  "description": "Ultracreepy horror comic from Japan's supreme master of the genre. Each volume is a short story on to its own.<br><br>\n1. Shimai (姉妹, Sisters)<br>\nTwo sisters slowly go insane waiting for their birthdays because it is foretold that all daughters born into that family will grow ugly when they turn eighteen.\n<br><br>\n2. Hone (骨, Bones)<br>\nA woman plagued by misfortune throughout her life fights for happiness.\n<br><br>\n3. Shuusai (秀才, Prodigy)<br>\nA beautiful baby boy's life changes dramatically when a robber slices his neck to stop him from crying. His once promising future now seems dismal just because of a horrific scar.\n<br><br>\n4. Furusato (ふるさと, Hometown)<br>\nIn the search for a better life in the city, a young man decides to leave his small village. After many years, he decides to return to the seemingly unchanging village. Orochi however can sense that something strange is going on.\n<br><br>\n5. Kagi (カギ, Key)<br>\nA misbehaving kid who always lies witnesses something horrific, and of course no one believes him!\n<br><br>\n6. Stage (ステージ)<br>\nA father pushes his son out of the way of a speeding car, only to be killed himself. Even though the son saw the hit-and-runner, the court of justice refuses to believe him because he is merely 3 years old. What happens when many years later a man that mysteriously looks just like the hit-and-runner becomes a famous singer?\n<br><br>\n7. Sentou (戦闘, Battle)<br>\nA son writes a poem about his selfless father. But what is the reason for his father's selflessness?\n<br><br>\n8. Me (眼, Eyes)<br>\nA blind girl witnesses a murder, but no one wants to believe her. Despite her blindness, she is determined to expose the truth.\n<br><br>\n9. Chi (血, Blood)<br>\nThe younger daughter of a wealthy and powerful family grows up being constantly compared to her seemingly perfect older sister. Their mother demands perfection, and the free-spirited younger daughter who is unable to meet her mother's standards is emotionally abused throughout her childhood. Decades later, Orochi finds herself front and center in the conclusion of the tragic story of these two sisters.\n\n<br><br><strong>Note</strong>: The correct chapter count is 62. Despite lacking more recognizable chapter breaks, it was originally published nearly every week for over a year in Shuukan Shounen Sunday with 62 appearances.\n",

          "description": "[Website](https://umezz-art.jp/)\n\nKazuo is the grandmaster of Japanese horror manga. He published his first manga while still at high school and began working professionaly in the field after his graduation. His first creations were 'Betsu-Sekai' ('Another World') and 'Mori-no-Kyoudai' ('The Brother and Sister in a Forest'). He mainly created his works for so-called Kashi-hon, magazines that were not for sale but for rent. He developed his detailed horror style in 1962, when he settled in Tokyo. His works 'Kuchi ga Mimi made Sake-ru Toki' ('The Moment The Mouth Tears to Ears'), 'Hebi Shoujo' ('The Snake Girl') and 'Hito-kobu Shoujo' ('A Girl Who Has A Human-faced Lump on Her Cheek') were his first claims to fame as a master in the horror genre.\n\nIn 2018 he was awarded the *Prize for Inheritance* at the *Angoulême International Comics Festival* for the French translation of *Watashi wa Shingo*. This was the second prize awarded him throughout his career and Umezu had previously been unhappy about the amount of recognition he had gotten for his work. The award motivated him to start working again and he produced a series of 101 paintings based on *Watashi wa Shingo* called *Zoku Shingo: Chiisana Robot Shingo Bijutsukan*, which were exhibited for the first time in 2022 and were his first new work in 27 years.\n\nHe passed away due to stomach cancer on October 28, 2024.",
