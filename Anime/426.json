  "description": "Planet R's luminous existence is maintained by four magical Crystals, each regulating a different essential element: Earth, Water, Fire and Wind. Long ago, sinister dark forces stole the Crystals and threatened to destroy the Planet. But, the courageous heroes fought desperately and defeated the dark forces to restore the planet to its peaceful state.<br>\n<br>\nTwo hundred years later - the great fight has been long forgotten and again, three Crystals have been stolen. The young descendants of the ancient heroes, Linaly and Prettz, are all that remain to protect the Crystal of Wind from the evil forces. If the two can managae to escape from Rouge - the leader of a leather-bound army of female pirates, they must still pass through the many dangerous obstacles that protect the magical crystal. Only the chosen one will survive the passage.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Urban Vision)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/136171134)\n\nA long-serving anime producer, as well as a founder of [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/) and [Studio M2](https://anilist.co/studio/6137/). He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "description": "Shigeyuki Hayashi, better known by his pseudonym Rintarou, is a well-known anime director.\n\nA film buff ever since he was a kid, he wanted to pursue a career in filmmaking. After having worked as a cel painter in commercial animation, he joined [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/) in 1958 for a brief time working on films such as [Hakujaden](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and [Saiyuuki](https://anilist.co/anime/4481/). After having been told that he couldn't work as a director due to not being a college graduate, he moved to [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) - making his directorial debut as one of the regular episode directors on [Tetsuwan Atom](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/).\n\nIn 1972, Rintarou left Mushi Pro to go freelance and to co-found [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11) together with [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/). A few years later, Rintarou got invited to direct [Jetter Mars](https://anilist.co/anime/6087/) at his previously disinterested workplace, Toei Animation. He accepted the offer but didn't join the studio as an employee, making him one of the few people who've directed for the studio while not being an inhouse employee. He continued to direct multiple entries for Toei, including [Arrow Emblem](https://anilist.co/anime/3800/), [Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/), as well as the 1979 film [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1301/), which is still considered by many as his best work.\n\n[Haruki Kadokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170354/), the president of [Kadokawa Shoten](https://anilist.co/studio/113/), took notice of the commercial success of Rintarou's works and hired him to direct [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/), which was the very first film produced by Kadokawa. The animation production was handled by Madhouse, where Rintarou changed his post at this time. There he continued his directorial efforts with numerous films and OVA series.\n\nThe older brother of [Masayuki Hayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/161046/).",

          "description": "Hironobu Sakaguchi co-founded Square with Masafumi Miyamoto in September of 1983. Their first games were very unsuccessful, so with no other choice, the pair decided to conclude their stay in the game industry by creating one title with the rest of Square's available funds. They called it: Final Fantasy. The game was released in Japan for the Famicom (also known internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System) on December 18, 1987 and became an instant hit across Japan. This, of course, surprised Sakaguchi-san, who decided to delay his retirement. Final Fantasy developed into a successful franchise under his watchful eye, and now spans from stand alone stories to spin-offs and direct sequels. After directing every title in the flagship series through Final Fantasy V) for the Super Famicom, he took on the role of executive producer for the series, along with producing many of Square's other game projects.    Sakaguchi has enjoyed a distinguished career in game development with his titles selling over 80 million units worldwide. A long-time proponent of bringing together the story-telling tradition of film and the interactive elements of games, he took on the directorial role on Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, an animated motion picture loosely based on previously established Final Fantasy series themes. Unfortunately, the movie was a catastrophic financial failure, the second-biggest animated box office bomb in cinema history, losing over $120 million and leading to the closure of Square Pictures. The upset, for which Sakaguchi was responsible, affected Square's financial capital, and may well have precipitated the merger with rival role-playing game creator Enix. As a consequence, feelings towards Sakaguchi's tenure at Square are somewhat mixed.    In 2000, Sakaguchi became the third person inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame. After voluntarily resigning from Square, he founded the game development studio Mistwalker with the financial backing of Microsoft Game Studios. In February of 2005 it was announced that Mistwalker would be working with Microsoft Game Studios to produce two role-playing titles for the Xbox 360 game console. Nevertheless, despite Microsoft's financial backing, Mistwalker remains independent of console exclusivity. Apart from Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, Sakaguchi is also producing Archaic Sealed Heat for Nintendo DS. He has at least three more titles planned for Nintendo game consoles.",
