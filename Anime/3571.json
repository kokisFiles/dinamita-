  "description": "The Mach is a racing car loaded with a new engine \"X\" specially developed and built by a man named Kenich Hibiki who was a racing driver as well as a motor engineer. However, in a test driving made prior to its completion, he was involved in an accident and judged as dead. Meanwhile his father Daisuke who was watching the test driving all the way recovered the wrecked car as his son`s memento. A few years later the damaged car rebuilt by him revives as the new Mach which comes to participate in Grand Prix. This time, however, for the purpose to protect the driver from a possible accident, the new car is equipped with a safety system called \"Safety Seven\" with seven guarding devices. Also, it is loaded with the engine \"X\" that miraculously survived the tragic accident. Now its driver is Go, younger brother of Kenichi, who is determined to succeed to his brother`s will. In fact, he successfully participates in Grand Prix and keeps growing up to be a top racer of the world.<br><br>\n(Source: official site)",

          "description": "Tatsuo Yoshida an anime pioneer who founded anime studio Tatsunoko Productions.\n\nBorn in 1932, Yoshida grew up in the hardship of war-torn Japan. A self-taught artist, his first job was as working for local newspapers in Kyoto. After finding success as a manga artist in Tokyo, including winning the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1972 for Minashigo Hutch, in 1962 he founded Tatsunoko with his two younger brothers, Kenji (who took over Tatsuo's position as producer after he died) and Toyoharu (a.k.a. Kuri Ippei). The studio's name has a double Japanese meaning of \"Tatsu's child\" and \"sea dragon\" which was the inspiration for its seahorse logo.\n\nUnderstanding the future of television, Yoshida made the jump from print to the screen and found modest success with the anime racing series Mach Go Go Go. Once adapted to the English language market, it would achieve Blockbuster status as Speed Racer around the world. Yoshida's magical talent for storytelling again found success with the action series Gatchaman (also known as Battle of the Planets) and Casshan (now remade as the live-action film Casshern).\n\nThough Yoshida Tatsuo's brilliant career was cut short by his untimely death from liver cancer in 1977, Tatsunoko Productions has continued to partner with top creators to create additional hit series such as Macross (Robotech), Mospeada, Generator Gawl, Time Bokan, and Karas.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

His talent for drawing was first discovered through various doodles and sketches he would make on company paperwork.\n\nYamashita's first project as an animator was on [the second Kochikame movie](https://anilist.co/anime/3547/). Some time later he went freelance. [Samurai Champloo](https://anilist.co/anime/205/) was the first project he worked on freelance.

A short while later, the animation department at Bee Train was spun off into new company, [C-Station](https://anilist.co/studio/6074/), and Yamashita moved with it.

Prior to joining Square Enix he worked for [Tatsunoko Production](https://anilist.co/studio/103/), a famous Japanese animation studio, which [Yoshitaka Amano](https://anilist.co/staff/97967/) spent much of his early career at, and did the character designs for Namco's Death by Degrees. For the latter, producer Youzou Sakagami hoped his Western sensibilities would help preserve the characters' intended Caucasian appearance, specifically noting that \"with games like Final Fantasy,\" Japanese designers tend to make white characters look Japanese.\n\nAside from his involvement within the Final Fantasy series, Ferrari also worked on The Last Remnant, Moon Diver, Song Summoner: The Unsung Heroes, Guns N' Souls feat. Song Summoner and Rampage Land Rankers.\n\nHe is listed alongside [Tetsuya Nomura](https://anilist.co/staff/97372/) as the main character designer for Final Fantasy VII Remake.\n\nHis works are recognizable by the trademark \"フェラーリ\" circled in red.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
