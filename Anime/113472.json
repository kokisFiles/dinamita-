She has covered over 200 songs in addition to performing, writing, composing and producing a large amount of original songs of her own.\n\nShe is well-known for her husky, low range vocals and for being a \"ryouseirui\", a term used to describe vocalists who are able to sing in both typical male and female vocal ranges. However, she is also able to sing in a very cute female voice, which can be heard in her cover of [Soratobazu](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm19159618).\n\n96Neko is also a Virtual YouTuber and posts her activities on her sub-channel. On October 5, 2019, she had announced her new VTuber persona by the name of Kuroki Natsume. As of July 9, 2021, she settled to merge the personas, expressing that she finds it limiting (and other factors) and decided to perform all her activities under her utaite name. However, she stated that people may still call her VTuber persona by whatever name they want, whether it be Kuroki Natsume or Kuroneko, and asked them to not worry.\n\n__Biography:__\nDuring her early utaite career on Nico Nico Douga, she would often do duets with the vocaloids [Kagamine Rin](https://anilist.co/staff/191794/Rin-Kagamine) and [Kagamine Len](https://anilist.co/staff/154290/Len-Kagamine). She also sung many parody songs, where she mostly dueted with Kagamine Len or [vipTenchou](https://twitter.com/viptentyo). In later years, she would start collaborating with the utaite [Amatsuki](https://anilist.co/staff/131102/Amatsuki) in duets.\n\n96Neko requested that people shouldn't record her anonymously with the intention of redistributing the footage commercially. She is fine with people recording for personal entertainment usage, however.\n\nHer album, Iris, which was released just three days before her twentieth birthday, was her way of thanking her fans and supporters prior to her turning twenty. It also served as a final installment to her teenage years as an utaite.",

Despite this, her most popular cover, \"Guren no Yumiya\" has already gained 3.1 million views as of July 2016, doing so in only a few months.\n\nShe can switch between both low and high voices with ease, which especially can be seen on her covers of \"E? Aa, Sou.\" and \"How-to Sekai Seifuku\" and notably in her newest album rootage/α. that was released on 2018/08/15.\n\nHer low voice is known to be unusually very powerful for a woman, while her high voice is very feminine and cute such as demonstrated in her cover of \"Chototsu Moushin Girl\" and notably in her newest album rootage/α. that was released on 2018/08/15\n\nJapanese: あるふぁきゅん。 (arufuakyun.)\nAlso known as: +α/Alfakyun.＋α/Alphakyun.\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnVDCsEQf-sl6X2ttbqlDHA) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alfa10alfa) | [Webiste](http://alfakyun.com/) | [nicovideo profile](http://www.nicovideo.jp/user/2834277) | [nicovideo mylist](http://www.nicovideo.jp/mylist/37540797) | [nicovideo community](http://com.nicovideo.jp/community/co2047182)",
