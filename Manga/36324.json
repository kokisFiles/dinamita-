As a member of his school's press club, he's just spent the summer camping outside the local military base, in hopes of seeing the UFOs that are secretly kept there, according to local legend. Returning to school, he meets a strange girl, Iriya Kana, and gradually comes to realize that she is more than merely strange - and that a dark secret lies beneath the world that he knows.",

In 1995, as his senior Furuhashi Hideyuki debuted as a light novel writer, Akiyama sent his own work to the Dengeki Novel Prize. That is how Akiyama, whose application was in fact too late for the due date, came into the notice of the editors at MediaWorks. His first novel E. G. Combat in 1998 was followed by science fiction and light novel works with his unique storytelling technique, which made Akiyama famous by his light novel series Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu. He self-deprecatingly describes himself as one \"who always look like a hooligan\" (found in his afterthoughts at the end of the first Iriya novel).",
