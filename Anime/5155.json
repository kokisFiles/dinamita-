          "description": "[Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/紫式部) | [Wiki (en)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murasaki_Shikibu)\n\nMurasaki Shikibu (973 or 978 - 1014 or 1031) was a Japanese novelist, poet and lady-in-waiting at the Imperial court during the Heian period. She is best known as the author of The Tale of Genji, widely considered to be one of the world's first novels, written in Japanese between about 1000 and 1012.\n\nMurasaki wrote The Diary of Lady Murasaki, a volume of poetry, and The Tale of Genji. Within a decade of its completion, Genji was distributed throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century her work was translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to recognize the importance of her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

They sing in Japanese and English.  [Ami Oonuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101448/), whose nickname is Jane, and [Yumi Yoshimura](https://anilist.co/staff/101449), nicknamed Sue, were scouted by Sony-affiliated talent agencies and put together in the mid-1990s. The band gained mainstream success in Japan during 1998, following the release of their Jet album and tour in support of it.  Their first release \"Asia no Junshin\" sold a million records and their success has continued with several more full-length releases (totaling 14 million sales in Japan). ",
