He then founded [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/) together with fellow former Mushi Pro employees, [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/). At Madhouse, he debuted as a director on 1984's [Lensman](https://anilist.co/anime/2770/), albeit still jointly with the more experienced [Kazunori Hirokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170070/). Kawajiri made his full-fledged directorial debuts in 1987, with [Wicked City](https://anilist.co/anime/1107/) and Running Man, the latter being a short film a part of an anthology collection, [Neo Tokyo](https://anilist.co/anime/1951/). Wicked City was originally meant to be a short film as well, but the producers were impressed enough in Kawajiri to let him turn it into a feature-length film. After these, Kawajiri directed [the third installment](https://anilist.co/anime/2998/) of Madhouse's adaptations of the highly acclaimed [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/) manga series, [Phoenix](https://anilist.co/manga/31325/).\n\nWicked City received critical and commercial success upon its release, giving Kawajiri more creative freedom. As a result of this he began writing the script for his own original film, [Ninja Scroll](https://anilist.co/anime/617/), a movie set in feudal Japan following a mercenary swordsman battling a team of ninjas with supernatural powers who are intent on overthrowing the Tokugawa shogunate. After the movie's international release, Kawajiri's status as a director received global recognition and he went on to direct multiple other works in the late '90s and early '00s.\n\nIn recent years, Kawajiri has taken a step back from directing, but has been guest appearing as a storyboard artist all over the industry.",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He wanted to work with esteemed Director [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/Osamu-Dezaki) since [Gamba's Adventure](https://anilist.co/anime/5267/Gambas-Adventure/) was particularly striking to him.\n\nInterested in effects animation, he cites [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/Yoshinori-Kanada) and [Kazuhide Tomonaga](https://anilist.co/staff/110219/Kazuhide-Tomonaga) as major influences. He had his first breakthrough as animator on [Space Adventure Cobra](https://anilist.co/anime/2451/Space-Adventure-Cobra/) and [Golgo 13: The Professional](https://anilist.co/anime/1760/), in which his effects work and fun character animation was highly praised. Later his work became increasingly more experimental, combining his animation with intricate art design and CGI.\n\nDuring his period at Annapuru he befriended [Takashi Nakamura](https://anilist.co/staff/102031/Takashi-Nakamura) and the two worked on several projects together even after leaving the studio. [Katsuhiro Ootomo](https://anilist.co/staff/96872/Katsuhiro-Ootomo) recognized his talent and Morimoto became a key figure in many of his works. He debuted as Director on [Robot Carnival](https://anilist.co/anime/2182/Robot-Carnival/).\n\nIn 1985 he founded [Studio 4°C](https://anilist.co/studio/13/) alongside former Ghibli producer [Eiko Tanaka](https://anilist.co/staff/103607/Tanaka-Eiko). He would later leave the studio in 2011.\n\nMarried to [Atsuko Fukushima](https://anilist.co/staff/118789/).",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/user/168586097)\n\nKoike aspired to become an animator after having seeing [Yoshinori Kanada](https://anilist.co/staff/106398/)'s work on [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1301/). During his third year of high school Koike came to Tokyo and quickly got a job at [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), and got thrown straight into [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/)'s projects. He made his debut as an in-betweener on [Phoenix: Karma Chapter](https://anilist.co/anime/2997/) and as a key animator on [Goku: Midnight Eye](https://anilist.co/anime/1879/).\n\nHis first venture into directing was in year 2000, when he got to direct the opening of Party 7, a film directed by [Katsuhito Ishii](https://anilist.co/staff/102102/). Koike also acted as the character designer and animation director on the film, getting to fully display his influences from above-mentioned legendary animator Yoshinori Kanada as well as Mike Mignola, an American comic artist of Hellboy fame.\n\nSome time after this began the notoriously lengthy seven year production of [Redline](https://anilist.co/anime/6675/). The film was eventually released in August 2009. Despite the positive critical response, with particular praise for its animation, Redline didn't have a successful run at the box office. It did however see a much greater success after its home release and has since been recognized as a cult film.",
