  "description": "This is Rumiko Takahashi at her darkest, but her trademark humor and romance also pop up in this three-volume series. Legend has it that if a human eats a mermaid's flesh, they will be granted eternal life. But is that a blessing or a curse? Immortal lovers Yuta and Mana travel through Japan and the centuries longing for a normal life. On their journey, they meet others who have consumed the flesh of a mermaid in hope of becoming immortal. But the powerful substance affects each person differently. Yuta and Mana are two of the lucky ones. Others are fated to die or transform into a savage monster, a \"lost soul.\"\n<br><br>\n(Source: Viz Media)\n<br><br>\n<i>This is the first volume of the Mermaid Saga series from the original tankoubon release, which includes the two-chapter stories \"A Mermaid Never Smiles\" (人魚は笑わない, Ningyo wa Warawanai), \"The Village of Fighting Fish\" (闘魚の里, Tōgyo no Sato), and \"Mermaid Forest\" (人魚の森, Ningyo no Mori Zenpen).</i>",

          "description": "\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/rumicworld1010)\n\nRumiko Takahashi is one of the wealthiest women in Japan. The manga she creates (and its anime adaptations) are very popular in the United States and Europe where they have been released as both manga and anime in English translation. Her works are relatively famous worldwide, and many of her series were some of the forerunners of early English language manga to be released in the nineties. Takahashi is also the best selling female comics artist in history; well over 100 million copies of her various works have been sold.\n\nThough she was said to occasionally doodle in the margins of her papers while attending Niigata Chūō High School, Takahashi's interest in manga did not come until later. During her college years, she enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike, mangaka of Crying Freeman and Lone Wolf and Cub. Under his guidance Rumiko Takahashi began to publish her first doujinshi creations in 1975, such as Bye-Bye Road and Star of Futile Dust. Kozue Koike often urged his students to create well-thought out, interesting characters, and this influence would greatly impact Rumiko Takahashi's works throughout her career.\n\nCareer and major works: Takahashi's professional career began in 1978. Her first published story was Those Selfish Aliens, a comedic science fiction story. During the same year, she published Time Warp Trouble, Shake Your Buddha, and the Golden Gods of Poverty in Shōnen Sunday, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years. Later that year, Rumiko attempted her first full-length series, Urusei Yatsura. Though it had a rocky start due to publishing difficulties, Urusei Yatsura would become one of the most beloved anime and manga comedies in Japan. In 1980, Rumiko Takahashi found her niche and began to publish with regularity. At this time she started her second major series, Maison Ikkoku, in Big Comic Spirits. Written for an older audience, Maison Ikkoku is often considered to be one of the all-time best romance manga. Takahashi managed to work on Maison Ikkoku on and off simultaneously with Urusei Yatsura. She concluded both series in 1987, with Urusei Yatsura ending at 34 volumes, and Maison Ikkoku being 15.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Takahashi became a prolific writer of short story manga, which is surprising considering the massive lengths of most of her works. Her stories The Laughing Target, Maris the Chojo, and Fire Tripper all were adapted into original video animations (OVAs). In 1984, after the end of Urusei Yatsura and Maison Ikkoku, Takahashi took a different approach to storytelling and began the dark, macabre Mermaid Saga. This series of short segments was published sporadically until 1994, with the final story being Mermaid's Mask. Many fans contend that this work remains unfinished by Takahashi, since the final story does not end on a conclusive note. Another short work left untouched is One-Pound Gospel, which, like Mermaid Saga, was published erratically. The last story to be drawn was published in 2001, however just recently she wrote one final chapter concluding the series.\n\nLater in 1987, Takahashi began her third major series, Ranma ½. Following the late 80s and early 90s trend of shōnen martial arts manga, Ranma ½ features a gender-bending twist. The series continued for nearly a decade until 1996, when it ended at 38 volumes. Ranma ½ is one of Rumiko Takahashi's most popular series with the Western world. During the later half of the 1990s, Rumiko Takahashi continued with short stories and her installments of Mermaid Saga and One-Pound Gospel until beginning her fourth major work, InuYasha. While Ranma ½, Urusei Yatsura, and Maison Ikkoku all were heavily seated in the romantic comedy genre, InuYasha was more akin to her dark Mermaid Saga. The series became her most eclectic work, featuring action, romance, horror, fantasy, (folklore-based) historical fiction, and comedy.\n\n",

In 1988, she began to study shoujo manga in earnest at the University of Illinois, where she earned a Master of Arts in East Asian & Pacific Studies. While shifting the focus of her study to what manga mean to the girls and women who read them, she also began professionally translating such manga as Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind, Ranma 1/2, and Banana Fish.\n\nIn 1991, she entered Columbia University's doctoral program in cultural anthropology. With a fellowship from the Japan Foundation, she conducted field work in the Hanshin area from 1994 to 1995. She earned a Master of Arts and a Master of Philosophy at Columbia. In addition to research and translation, she wrote a column on for Animerica and became known as a shoujo manga evangelist. In 1997, she moved to Kyoto and began teaching at Kyoto Seika University. In 1998, she began work on creating a \"department of story manga\" for the university, and in 2000 she became a permanent, full-time associate professor in the newly created program.\n\nIn Japanese, she's written columns for Dokushojin, The Japan Times Weekly ST, and Kyoto Newspaper. From 2003 to 2005, she served as a judge in the Tezuka Osamu Culture Award.
