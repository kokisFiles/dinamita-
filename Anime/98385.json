Her name comes from the verb \"aimer\" in French which means \"to love.\" She is known for being a faceless voice. She very rarely appears on her music videos and most of her live performances are dimly lit to obscure her face. She finally revealed herself on the August 20, 2016 episode of Music Station.\n\nHer father was the bassist of a band, so Aimer grew up surrounded by music from a very young age. She began studying the piano in elementary school and highly looked up to Ringo Sheena and Utada Hikaru. In junior high school, listening to Avril Lavigne inspired her to take up guitar and began writing English lyrics. At the age of 15, Aimer lost her voice due to over-usage of her vocal cords and was forced to undergo silence therapy for treatment. However, that did not stop her, and after she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky voice.\n\nAimer teamed up with the \"Agehasprings\" group, which has worked with, produced, or provided music for various artists, including Yuki, Mika Nakashima, Flumpool, Superfly, Yuzu, and Genki Rockets. In 2011, her musical career began in earnest. In May 2011, they released the concept album \"Your Favorite Things.\" It covered numerous popular works, including works in various genre such as jazz and country western music.\n\nMarried [Masahiro Tobinai](https://anilist.co/staff/146979/Masahiro-Tobinai) in 2023.",

Her birth was privately held, and only shown to be on a January 27.\n\n<b>Biography:</b>\nCHiCO is a female japanese singer that is currently under the label: <a href=\"https://musicrayn.com/chico\">MusicRay'n Inc.</a> While growing up CHiCO was very interested in <a href=\"https://jpop.fandom.com/wiki/Anison\">anison</a> (a term used to abbreviate <b>A</b><b>n</b><b>i</b>me <b>s</b><b>o</b><b>n</b>g, but is also used <i>generally</i> when referring to anime music that has a focus on opening and ending theme songs). Upon entering high school she was introduced to a voice training teacher by an acquaintance she knew at the time, this pushed her to become a professional singer.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, CHiCO entered the national singer audition \"Utakatsu!\" (specializing in \"Anison\" and \"Vocaloid\") hosted by Sony Music Entertainment SD Group. She won the grand prize at the contest, which led to a decision to collaborate with the creator group \"[HoneyWorks](https://anilist.co/staff/146863/HoneyWorks)\".\n\nOn the 6th of August, 2014, CHiCO debuted with the opening theme song for the anime \"<a href=\"https://anilist.co/anime/20596/Ao-Haru-Ride/\">Ao Haru Ride</a>\" named \"Sekai wa Koi Ni Ochiteiru\" under the guise of \"CHiCO with HoneyWorks\". This was her official debut as a singer.\n\nOn the 18th of November, 2015, CHiCO together with HoneyWorks released their first album named \"Sekai Ha i Ni Michiteiru\". This was CHiCO's first ever album release, and the album sold 24,000 copies during its first week of sale.",

Her name comes from the verb \"aimer\" in French which means \"to love.\" She is known for being a faceless voice. She very rarely appears on her music videos and most of her live performances are dimly lit to obscure her face. She finally revealed herself on the August 20, 2016 episode of Music Station.\n\nHer father was the bassist of a band, so Aimer grew up surrounded by music from a very young age. She began studying the piano in elementary school and highly looked up to Ringo Sheena and Utada Hikaru. In junior high school, listening to Avril Lavigne inspired her to take up guitar and began writing English lyrics. At the age of 15, Aimer lost her voice due to over-usage of her vocal cords and was forced to undergo silence therapy for treatment. However, that did not stop her, and after she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky voice.\n\nAimer teamed up with the \"Agehasprings\" group, which has worked with, produced, or provided music for various artists, including Yuki, Mika Nakashima, Flumpool, Superfly, Yuzu, and Genki Rockets. In 2011, her musical career began in earnest. In May 2011, they released the concept album \"Your Favorite Things.\" It covered numerous popular works, including works in various genre such as jazz and country western music.\n\nMarried [Masahiro Tobinai](https://anilist.co/staff/146979/Masahiro-Tobinai) in 2023.",
