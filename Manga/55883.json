  "description": "A \"what if\" alternative version of the original story, on which the cast gets acquainted in a different manner.<br>\nThe basic premise is that Kodaka, a rude looking and easily misunderstood transfer student catches a glimpse from a conversation between Sena (the most popular girl on school) and \"her friend\" Renka (a character from a visual novel); after a short discussion followed, Sena decides to give it a try and make some friends with Kodaka's help.<br>\nThis is a tweak from the original premise, on which Kodaka catches Yozora speaking to her \"air friend\", and is Yozora the one who decides to start practicing how to make friends with Kodaka's help.",

He debuted in 2009 as a manga artist, and made his major debut as a musician in 2012 with the album [Sheerlore](https://open.spotify.com/album/2nSXAgq3PDnpWOq9XLoFmk?si=othpfRzdSzKq8zos9SnIHg), under the group Sentimental-Vector. \n\nTaguchi currently releases music under his own name, as well as under the group Sentimental-Vector. He tends to work with the artist Annabel and her band [siraph](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4OQN2l6vYHuqeXFp3M5ZYb?si=VA1CvI5pRGa3cHo1NsoqMQ), but he has also worked with other musical artists such as [Jin](https://anilist.co/staff/113249/Jin), [sasakure.UK](https://anilist.co/staff/167713/sasakureUK) and [school food punishment](https://anilist.co/staff/102508/School-Food-Punishment).\n\n__Biography:__\nDuring his time in the band Sentimental Vector, he at one point made several guest vocal appearance in the Kagerou Project.
