          "description": "He debuted in 1979 with the story [Wonder Island](https://anilist.co/manga/112596/Wonder-Island/), published in Weekly Shounen Jump, and first gained popularity for the anime and manga series [Dr. Slump](https://anilist.co/manga/30796/Dr-Slump/), originally serialized weekly in Shounen Jump from 1980 to 1984. In 1982, he won the Shogakukan Manga Award for Dr. Slump for best shounen or shoujo manga series of the year.  In 1984, Toriyama was responsible for developing [Dragon Ball](https://anilist.co/manga/30042/Dragon-Ball/) which was initially serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump. It became an instant accomplishment—primarily selling over 35,000,000 copies in Japan, Dragon Ball eventually became a record-breaking best seller with over 120,000,000 copies sold. Aside from the Japanese fame, the series was equally successful internationally as well, including in Europe (1988), Canada (1996) and Latin America. Its success encouraged Toriyama to continue working on Dragon Ball from 1984 to 1995. During that eleven-year period, he produced 519 chapters, collected into 42 volumes. Each volume has an average of 200 pages. Moreover, the benefit of the manga led to three anime adaptations, numerous feature-length animated movies, several video games, and mega-merchandising. Toriyama's studio is called \"Bird Studio\", which is a play on his name, \"tori\" meaning \"bird.\"\n\nToriyama married his wife [Yoshimi Kato](https://anilist.co/staff/311142/Nachi-Mikami) on May 2, 1982. She is a former manga artist from Nagoya under the pen name \"Nachi Mikami\" and occasionally helped Toriyama and his assistant on Dr. Slump when they were short on time. Together with his wife, he had two children: a son born in 1987, and a daughter born in 1990. He was a well-known recluse, who avoided appearing in public or media.\n\nOn March 8, 2024, it was announced that Toriyama passed away at the age of 68 from acute subdural hematoma.",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hosodamamoru)\n\nHosoda initially felt inspired to take up animation as a career after seeing [The Castle of Cagliostro](https://anilist.co/anime/1430/), the first film directed by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/). He majored in oil painting at the Kanazawa College of Art in Ishikawa Prefecture. After graduation, Hosoda was able to land an animation job at [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/), after submitting a short film that he had animated in his spare time. He initially applied at [Studio Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/); though he did not get the job, he received a rejection letter of praise from Hayao Miyazaki himself.\n\nDuring his time at Toei, Hosoda worked his way up, garnering public attention in the early 2000s with the first two films in the Digimon series. It was his first co-directed film, [Digimon: The Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/2961/), which attracted the eye of Ghibli head producer [Toshio Suzuki](https://anilist.co/staff/101638/).\n\nStudio Ghibli announced that Hosoda was to direct the film [Howl's Moving Castle](https://anilist.co/anime/431/) in September 2001. This was scheduled for a summer 2003 release. However, production on the film became strained due to creative differences. According to Hosoda, he \"was told to make the movie similar to how Miyazaki would have made it, but he wanted to make his own film the way he wanted to make it\". In the end, Hosoda left in the summer of 2002 during the early production stages, after failing to come up with a concept acceptable to Studio Ghibli bosses.\n\nProceeding his departure from Ghibli, Hosoda returned to Toei and worked on a few animations in collaboration with artist Takashi Murakami, such as the commercial Superflat Monogram for Louis Vuitton. During this time, he directed an episode of [Ojamajo Doremi](https://anilist.co/anime/353/), which was inspired by his turbulent time at Ghibli. This episode led to him being hired at the animation studio [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/), which he worked at from 2005 to 2011.\n\nAt Madhouse, Hosoda earned critical acclaim with his directing efforts. His two movies, [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://anilist.co/anime/2236/) and [Summer Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/5681/), both won the Japan Academy Film Prize award.\n\nIn 2011, Hosoda left Madhouse to establish his own animation studio, [Studio Chizu](https://anilist.co/studio/555/), with Yuuichirou Saitou who produced both previously mentioned award winning shows. As of August 2020, Studio Chizu has released three films directed by Hosoda: 2012's [Wolf Children](https://anilist.co/anime/12355/), 2015's [The Boy and the Beast](https://anilist.co/anime/20981/), and 2018's [Mirai](https://anilist.co/anime/100749/). Which of Mirai was nominated for Best Animated Feature for the 2019 Oscars.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n__Notable Awards:__\n\n- **The Girl Who Leapt Through Time**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2007)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2007)\n\\- Winner, Best Animation of the Year (Japan Academy Film Prize 2007)\n\n- **Summer Wars**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Original Story (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Notable Entry (Tokyo Anime Award 2009)\n\\- Winner, Best Animation of the Year (Japan Academy Film Prize 2010)\n\n- **Wolf Children**\n\\- Winner, Animation of the Year (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Best Director (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Best Screenplay (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\\- Winner, Notable Entry (Tokyo Anime Award 2013)\n\n- **Mirai**\n\\- Nominee, Best Animated Feature Film (Academy Awards, USA)\n\n(Source: IMDb)",

As Sakai was the only member who stayed in the group while others joined and left regularly, Zard and Sakai may be referred to interchangeably. She was the best-selling female recording artist of the 1990s and has sold over 37 million copies of sales, making her one of the best-selling music artists in Japan of all time.\n\nSakai produced 42 singles as well as 11 albums and 5 compilations in her lifetime. In addition to \"Makenaide,\" she produced two other singles that sold over a million copies. Six of her albums as well as her first three compilations also surpassed the one-million mark. Sakai's CD sales had been in decline since 2000, but her death triggered an increase in CD sales.\n\n In June 2006, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, for which she immediately underwent treatment. She appeared to have healed, but discovered that her cancer had spread to her lungs, indicating a Stage 4 cancer. She began undergoing treatment at Keio University Hospital in April 2007 but she never fully recovered. Sakai died on May 27, 2007 due to an accidental fall at the hospital where she was undergoing chemotherapy.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
