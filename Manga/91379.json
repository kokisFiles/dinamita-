          "description": "She was a manga artist and researcher in the lifestyles and customs of Japan's Edo period. Born into a tradition-steeped family of kimono merchants, she studied design and took an increasing interest in old Japan. She attended Nihon University, but gave up her formal studies to pursue research under the direction of author Shisei Inagaki. Inagaki specialized in the Edo period and taught Sugiura how to do the background surveys that would later ensure the historical accuracy of her manga and other works.\n\nSugiura was the assistant of [Murasaki Yamada](https://anilist.co/staff/153699/Murasaki-Yamada), a prominent feminist mangaka. Sugiura debuted in 1980 with her work, \"Tsugen Muro no Ume,\" which was published in the alternative manga magazine Garo. Her distinctive style drew heavily on ukiyo-e techniques and breathed life into her depictions of Edo-period life and customs, helping her win popularity as well as the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for her manga \"Gassou\" in 1984 and the Bungei Shunjuu Manga Award for Fūryū Edo Suzume in 1988.\n\nIn 1993, Sugiura announced that she was retiring from her life as a manga artist to dedicate herself to research on Edo period lifestyles and customs. She wrote numerous books on the subject, which she considered to be her life's work, and frequently appeared in the media as an expert on the period. She was well known and liked for her commentary during the ending segment of a popular NHK program, Comedy: O-Edo de Gozaru, which was set in the Edo period. Sugiura was usually seen in public wearing traditional kimono.\n\nWhen Sugiura left the Comedy: O-Edo de Gozaru program, she told the public that she was going to fulfill a long-cherished dream by taking a world cruise. That she was actually undergoing treatment for cancer of the throat (the hypopharynx) at a hospital in Kashiwa, Chiba, first become known when the public learned of her death at 46 on July 22, 2005.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)",
