They were born in 1973, but the month and day are unknown.  Amano began in 1998 with a job at Weekly Young Magazine. They also held a job at Shueisha Publishing Co, Ltd.  In 2002, Amano participated in a contest for aspiring mangaka and was one of the lucky winners, with their comic Monkey Business published in Young Magazine.  In 2004, they finally found success with the humorous and classy manga Katekyo Hitman Reborn! (or, for short, just Reborn!), and that thanks to their readers' support. This new manga was advertised more and more in Shonen Jump and became a hit. Two years later, their manga was made into an anime series by Artland studios. \n\nTheir ideas for Reborn!: Amano had some crazy ideas to entertain readers with. They came up with weird characters to add spice to the humor, a story written especially to be unique, and fast-paced action.    \n\nOther works:  Boy Spin (1998)  Hot Blast Baseball Legendary (1999)  Pu Chipu Chirabii (2000)  Monkey Business (2002)  Tapir Hearts HAWK!

[Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/) and Bebow’s founder [Tomonori Kogawa](https://anilist.co/staff/105957/) were also graduates of the same school - the latter whom he would study under after joining the studio. There he made his debut as a key animator on [Seisenshi Dunbine](https://anilist.co/anime/929/) in the following year.\n\nHe left Bebow in the mid ‘80s and joined Pack, a small studio established by [Hiroyuki Kitazume](https://anilist.co/staff/106775/). During this time he was a follower of Kitazume’s, who has said that Onda was the one capable of replicating his drawing’s the best out of the people who worked at studio Pack. After that he joined [Atelier Giga](https://anilist.co/staff/106775/) and worked there until becoming a freelancer.\n\nHis drawings feature western-influenced delicate and sharp linework with an excellent grasp on three-dimensionality. His character art in particular is highly praised both inside and outside of the industry, which he gets to brandish whenever he works as an animation supervisor. He has stated that he prefers character design and supervision work over working as an animator himself.\n\nIn 2003, he took part as a key animator on [Production I.G](https://anilist.co/studio/10/)'s animated segment in Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" directed by [Kazuto Nakazawa](https://anilist.co/staff/101474/).
