Led by composer, drummer, and pianist Yoshiki, the band has sold more than 30 million albums, singles, and videos combined, sold out Japan’s 55,000-seat Tokyo Dome 18 times, and played to millions of fans around the world. In the band’s early days, their look and sound sparked a global interest in the Japanese cultural rock phenomenon “Visual-Kei”, a movement X Japan pioneered that spread worldwide.\n\nIn 1997, at the height of their success, the band broke up. Four months later, Hide, X Japan’s original lead guitarist, was found dead in his Tokyo apartment. At his funeral, more than 50,000 fans came to mourn his passing. In early 2007, Yoshiki and vocalist Toshl reunited, and later that year X Japan officially reformed.\n\n\n__Members:__\n• [**YOSHIKI**](https://anilist.co/staff/115552) - Yoshiki Hayashi [林佳樹] (b.
