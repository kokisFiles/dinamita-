Despite being a kitten, he does not intend to let himself be carried away by this sinister character. Between fascination for the absurd, and immoderate taste for a sweet wickedness, Nekojiru stages Nyato and Nyata, who under their airs of cute little kittens, will set fire to the whole planet.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: IMHO, translated)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note:<br>\n-Originally serialized in Monthly Manga Garo for 31 chapters, starting with the 1990-06 and ending with the 1995-10 issue.<br>\n-Incomplete 2-volume tankoubon (23 chs) published by Seirindo in 1992 and 1995.<br>\n-Complete 3-volume tankoubon published by Bungeishunjuu in 1998 and 1999.

She committed suicide on May 10, 1998. As per her own and her families wishes, she is buried in an unmarked grave. Yoshiaki Yoshinaga has written about his friendship with Nekojiru, along with more stories about her, and her eventual suicide, in a memoir dedicated to her titled \"Memories of Nekojiru\".\n\nWith the exception of Tsunami, all Nekojiru's work has main characters drawn as cats. Even in her manga essays, Jirujiru Travel Journal and Jirujiru Diary, she drew herself as a cat. But though the characters appear as animals, the artist chose as her setting not a forest, but rather the human world. Her manga detailing the daily life and adventures of the cats Nyāko and Nyatta are held in high esteem. The major themes of her work are a child-like zaniness, cruelty and nostalgia. And, as we know from Dream Memo, included in the posthumously released compilation Nekojiru Udon 3, many of her bizarre works of fantasy were based on her own dream experiences. Psychedelic mushrooms and LSD also often appear in her works. Her husband Yamano Hajime, using the pen-name Nekojiru-y, took over Nekojiru's world, and continues to produce new works. Currently on his official site, one can read a free chapter of Nekojiru's manga.",
