She studied keyboard from a young age on both the piano in her home and the organ at her kindergarten. In elementary school, she began participating in composition contests, but in high school, Kanno began to take more of an interest in literature than in music.\n\nShe attended Waseda University, where she majored in literature, but she transcribed music for various student groups at Waseda in her free time. While in university, Koei, a Japanese video game company, asked her to compose the soundtrack to Nobunaga's Ambition. The game turned out to be a hit, and Kanno's music career was launched.\n\nKanno has also composed music for artists such as [Maaya Sakamoto](https://anilist.co/staff/95090/), [Megumi Nakajima](https://anilist.co/staff/96105/) and [Kyouko Koizumi](https://anilist.co/staff/164646/). She is also a keyboardist, as well as the frontwoman for [Seatbelts](https://anilist.co/staff/193673/), who perform many of Kanno's compositions and soundtracks.\n\nShe has collaborated with directors [Shinichirou Watanabe](https://anilist.co/staff/97009/) and [Shouji Kawamori](https://anilist.co/staff/97501/) multiple times.\n\nIn addition to Japanese, she speaks a little English and some French.",

One of his first representative works was an independently produced animation titled \"Moonstruck Artemis,\" that he made while part of a manga club during his university days. Aramaki didn't have a special desire to work in the animation industry, but has stated joining it solely because he could draw and the industry had a wide range of options for someone like that. He has also said that the spread of digital technology has made it easier for him to work in both anime and live-action.\n\nIn 2004, Aramaki directed [Appleseed](https://anilist.co/anime/54/), a re-interpretation of a [Shirou Masamune](https://anilist.co/staff/97609/) manga by [the same name](https://anilist.co/manga/30668/). Although bashed by critics, the movie was an influential piece in the medium that had great impact on creators around the world.

During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/).

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ushimou730) | [Wiki (jp)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/馬越嘉彦)\n\nA highly prolific and respected character designer.\n\nOriginating from Monsieur Onion, where he spent his in-betweening days studying under [Hirotoshi Takaya](https://anilist.co/staff/117473/) and [Junichi Hayama](https://anilist.co/staff/140660/). In 1991, he moved to Studio Cockpit with [Hisashi Kagawa](https://anilist.co/staff/120432/) and [Tatsufumi Tamakawa](https://anilist.co/staff/109607/). A few years later he debuted as a character designer on [Grappler Baki](https://anilist.co/anime/1859/) in 1994.\n\nHe is said to be a very fast and efficient worker, and according to himself, he much rather participates in TV productions than theatrical ones. Close friends with [Hiroshi Nagahama](https://anilist.co/staff/99346/) whom he often works with. They first worked together on [Juubei-chan 2](https://anilist.co/anime/636/), for which Umakoshi provided the designs for and served as the chief animation director on all 13 episodes. The following year, the duo teamed up again for [Mushishi](https://anilist.co/anime/457/), which's production quality was unusually high for a TV production. Umakoshi designed the characters and worked as the chief animation director on all 26 episodes of the series and hit a burn-out. After this he took a step back on major roles for a few years. Both him and Nagahama reprised their roles on Mushishi's revival in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Umakoshi was appointed as the character designer on [My Hero Academia](https://anilist.co/anime/21459/), and has since been highly involved with the series' production as both an animation director and animator.",
