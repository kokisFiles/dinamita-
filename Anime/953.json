Given only a beam knife and a smelly satchel, they wander together in search of civilization on the primarily plant based world. They soon discover the plants have the advantage. Only the strong survive; the ones who throw away their humanity and become the beasts humans once were.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

The promise he showed in the program led him to be selected as assistant director to [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/) in [Spirited Away](https://anilist.co/anime/199/).\n\nIn 2008, he made his full directorial debut with [Bounen no Xamdou](https://anilist.co/anime/4177/). In an interview to The Japan Times, Miyaji stated that he believed anime was a part of the film industry, and said in respect to Xamdou's \"theatrical dimension,\" he had wished to use an \"almost documentary style\" for certain parts and listed directors Ken Loach and Jean-Luc Godard as his inspirations. He also felt he could reach a different kind of an audience with the series' unique Playstation Network release.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/).
