          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fujishimakosuke)\n\nKosuke Fujishima is a Japanese manga artist.\n\nHe first came to public attention as an editor of Puff magazine, his first job after completing high school. Fujishima originally intended to be a draftsman, but took the editorial role after failing to get a drafting apprenticeship. He later became assistant to manga artist [Tatsuya Egawa](https://anilist.co/staff/98034/Tatsuya-Egawa) in the production of the Making Be Free! manga, and in 1986 began his first original manga series You're Under Arrest. His second manga series Oh My Goddess!, also translated as Ah! My Goddess, is Fujishima's most famous work, which made him a household name in Japan. He is also well known as the character designer for several games in the Tales series and Sakura Wars.\n\nHe is known for his love of automobiles and motorcycles, and several of his series and their characters reflect this, such as in éX-Driver and Oh My Goddess!.\n\nOn June 29, 2016, the famous 20-year-old cosplayer Nekomu Otogi announced her marriage to Fujishima as well as her pregnancy on her Twitter page. On July 7, 2016, Fujishima confirmed the marriage on his Twitter account.",
