  "description": "1. <b>Hotel: Since 2079</b><br>\nIt is the year 2272 A.D. A computer continues to live on in order to complete a mission in a world where all life, including Mankind, has gone extinct. This is a record of those 27 million years of its heroic struggle.\n<br><br>\n2. <b>Present</b><br>\nHanako suffers from a terrible disease. After awakening from a deep slumber, Hanako has only three days to live. Set in the future, Present tells a story based on human feelings where the truth isn’t always what it seems.\n<br><br>\n3. <b>Subete wa Maguro no Tame datta</b> (It Was All for the Tuna)<br>\nTuna have become extinct and Jun Shiozaki will do everything possible and imaginable to bring them back.\n<br><br>\n4. <b>Stephanos</b><br>\nSet in modern-day Japan, our main character Noriko finds out that she is pregnant with her lover Matsumura’s baby. He, however, is an important doctor with a family and everything already. Noriko wants to have the baby, but Matsumura says that it’s actually a rapidly growing cancer and that they have to remove it immediately. It might also be neither of these things…\n<br><br>\n5. <b>Diadem</b><br>\nA \"Diadem\" is a word for 'crown' that has its root in Greek. \"Stephanos\", which appeared in \"Mandala\" 01, was also a 'crown'. It seems that we could consider this the second work in a continuing series of shorts that should perhaps be called a \"Crown series.",
