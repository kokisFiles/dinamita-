From an early age, he was disturbed by what he perceived to be the social inequity between his well-to-do family and the impoverished farmers in the area from whom his family profited by lending them money.\n\nFrom 1926 until his death from pneumonia in 1933, Miyazawa struggled to improve the material and spiritual life of the impoverished peasants of his native Iwate. He introduced new agricultural techniques and new varieties of seeds. He left his position as instructor at Hanamaki Agriculture School in 1926 to establish the Rasu Farmers Association. At the detached house of his family, where he was staying at the time, he gathered a group of youths from nearby farming families and lectured on agronomy. The association also engaged in plays, music, and other cultural activities.\n\nHis writings from this period show sensitivity for the land and for the people who work in it. A prolific writer of children's stories, many that appear superficially to be light or humorous, all contain stories intended for moral education of the reader. He wrote some works in prose and some stage plays for his students and left behind a large amount of tanka and free verse, most of which was discovered and published posthumously. His poetry, which has been translated into numerous languages, has a considerable following to this day. A number of his children’s works have been made into animated movies (anime) in Japan.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Suzuki is renowned as one of Japan's most successful producers after the enormous national box office success of many Ghibli films.\n\nHe was instrumental in getting the [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/) anime made and helped establish Studio Ghibli shortly after the film's release. Miyazaki has stated, \"If it were not for Mr. Suzuki, there wouldn't have been Studio Ghibli.\" Ghibli co-founder [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/), has acknowledged the pivotal role of Suzuki in bringing the Nausicaä manga series into the world and used nearly identical words as Miyazaki to acknowledge Suzuki’s essential role in the creation of Studio Ghibli. Takahata also credits Suzuki for his steadfast support of Miyazaki and has cited Suzuki’s responsibility for making his friendship with Miyazaki endure.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Later he joined [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11/) for a brief time, working as an art director on titles such as [Barefoot Gen](https://anilist.co/anime/1824/) and [Wicked City](https://anilist.co/anime/1107/). After this he was scouted out by [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), who was searching for a new art director for Studio Ghibli.\n\nAt Ghibli he was appointed as the art director for [My Neighbour Totoro](https://anilist.co/anime/523/), in which he was praised for his work by both Miyazaki and [Isao Takahata](https://anilist.co/staff/100579/). He worked at Ghibli for many years taking part in the production of most of their films. During this time he also worked on non-Ghibli works. Oga has since left the studio and is now freelance.\n\nHe has also published several art books and acts as an advisor at Deho Gallery.",
