  "description": "The local law enforcement has a problem: the Demon Seed — a small but surprisingly capable gang with a charismatic leader. Their mecha body suits allow them to undertake spectacular crimes that regularly rampage the city and totally humiliate the police.<br><br>\nDesperate, the police have created a special branch just to deal with them. However, these unlucky few are not having any better results than the regular police and the public is turning against them. If they could just foil the Demon Seed once it would make their careers so much easier.<br><br>\nThey just need a plan... luckily chief Hattori has come up with something the Demon Seed gang will definitely never expect. Hatched from chief's alcohol-induced mind, the plan is so bizarre that it just might work: Find the perfect crime fighter who is so powerful and captivating that even if they do not beat the Demon Seed gang, the public just will not care! And who could this person be? An idol singer of course!<br><br>\nThe cute and innocent 14-year-old Namikaze Maron cannot sing or even dance, but she has the only talent the job really requires: superhuman strength! Now Hattori and his crew must mold her into the perfect idol singer and turn Maron into their ultimate weapon... but at what cost? Can she really survive the Demon Seed's onslaught?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/kenokun)\n\nKouhei attended Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music (Music Faculty, Composition Department), studying under Tomojirou Ikenouchi and other professors. He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work. Another of his most important work is often said to be [Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar](https://anilist.co/anime/890/), and the [sequel](https://anilist.co/anime/1382/) following it.\n\nIn 2002, he won the first Tokyo Anime Award for Best Music for his work on [Overman King Gainer](https://anilist.co/anime/1792/).",

          "description": "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/kenokun)\n\nKouhei attended Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music (Music Faculty, Composition Department), studying under Tomojirou Ikenouchi and other professors. He worked for three consecutive years at Victor Music Industries after he graduated from the University. He attended Berklee College of Music for two years after he left Victor Music Industries. After returning to Japan, Kouhei started his activities as a composer.\n\nThough Kouhei had been playing at the hotel at first, he was requested to compose an insert song for \"Arcadia of My Youth: Endless Orbit SSX\", a 1982 TV anime, and it became his first work as a composer. Afterwards, he handled some more compositions of insert songs, this time for the Super Sentai series and he also did the composition of the background music for a TV anime, Konpora Kid, in 1985.\n\nNotably, the score for [Top wo Nerae! Gunbuster](https://anilist.co/anime/949/) made his name and talent very famous among anime fans, and is recognized as one of his most important works. He also handled the composition of [Top wo Nerae 2! Diebuster](https://anilist.co/anime/1002/) and showed a peculiar arrangement, which he added to his previous 17-year-old work. Another of his most important work is often said to be [Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar](https://anilist.co/anime/890/), and the [sequel](https://anilist.co/anime/1382/) following it.\n\nIn 2002, he won the first Tokyo Anime Award for Best Music for his work on [Overman King Gainer](https://anilist.co/anime/1792/).",

          "description": "A co-founder and a board member of [Bones](https://anilist.co/studio/4/).\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Kawamoto was first employed in the making and designing of precision machinery. During this early period, he became interested in becoming an animator due to the ongoing [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1088/) series, [Yoshiyuki Tomino](https://anilist.co/staff/97337/)'s [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) and [Gainax](https://anilist.co/studio/6/)'s amateur [Daicon](https://anilist.co/anime/2724/) films. In particular, [Yoshikazu Yasuhiko](https://anilist.co/staff/97220/)'s work was a major influence.\n\nAfter graduating, he applied for a small sub-contracting studio called Group Donguri and was accepted. In 1986, he made his debut in Yasuhiko's 1986 film [Arion](https://anilist.co/anime/791/). During the production he was mentored by the character designer [Sachiko Kamimura](https://anilist.co/staff/112663/), with whom he would later work with on multiple occasions, including being her assistant in [Venus Wars](https://anilist.co/anime/544/), which was also written and directed by Yasuhiko. After this Kawamoto worked on numerous series by [Sunrise](https://anilist.co/studio/14/), most notably as a character designer on the Gundam entries, [Stardust Memory](https://anilist.co/anime/84/) and [The 08th MS Team](https://anilist.co/anime/81/), as well as the internationally acclaimed [Cowboy Bebop](https://anilist.co/anime/1/).\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded Bones with fellow Sunrise staff members [Masahiko Minami](https://anilist.co/staff/101519/) and [Hiroshi Ousaka](https://anilist.co/staff/107410/).

          "description": "A notable mechanical and character designer for both anime and tokusatsu series.\n\nHe aspired a career in the industry after having seen [Space Battleship Yamato](https://anilist.co/anime/1650/), a franchise in which he would eventually serve as a director [in 2012](https://anilist.co/anime/12029/). His career began in 1978, debuting as a mechanical designer on [Toushou Daimos](https://anilist.co/anime/2816/), designing the enemy robots. Few years later in 1981, he made his tokusatsu debut on Robot 8-chan.\n\nThe following decade he worked on industry shaping series such as [Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/86/), [Macross](https://anilist.co/anime/1089/) and [Patlabor](https://anilist.co/anime/324/). During this time he also had ties to Parallel Creation, a creative group led by sci-fi writer [Aritsune Toyota](https://anilist.co/staff/220367/). This led him to work as an illustrator on novels such as [Record of Lodoss War](https://anilist.co/manga/92655/), in which his designs were deeply influential for Japanese fantasy series.\n\nIn 2002, he directed [RahXephon](https://anilist.co/anime/165/), an anime original created by him. Izubuchi said that his attempt was to set a new standard for mecha anime, as well as to bring back aspects of '70s mecha shows like [Brave Raideen](https://anilist.co/anime/2128/).\n\nA trademark in his mechanical designs is the Buchi-hole (ブチ穴), a series of round holes embedded, usually in a cluster pattern of three holes above and two below, located somewhere on the mecha.",
