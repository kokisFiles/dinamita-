          "description": "Tatsuo Yoshida an anime pioneer who founded anime studio Tatsunoko Productions.\n\nBorn in 1932, Yoshida grew up in the hardship of war-torn Japan. A self-taught artist, his first job was as working for local newspapers in Kyoto. After finding success as a manga artist in Tokyo, including winning the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1972 for Minashigo Hutch, in 1962 he founded Tatsunoko with his two younger brothers, Kenji (who took over Tatsuo's position as producer after he died) and Toyoharu (a.k.a. Kuri Ippei). The studio's name has a double Japanese meaning of \"Tatsu's child\" and \"sea dragon\" which was the inspiration for its seahorse logo.\n\nUnderstanding the future of television, Yoshida made the jump from print to the screen and found modest success with the anime racing series Mach Go Go Go. Once adapted to the English language market, it would achieve Blockbuster status as Speed Racer around the world. Yoshida's magical talent for storytelling again found success with the action series Gatchaman (also known as Battle of the Planets) and Casshan (now remade as the live-action film Casshern).\n\nThough Yoshida Tatsuo's brilliant career was cut short by his untimely death from liver cancer in 1977, Tatsunoko Productions has continued to partner with top creators to create additional hit series such as Macross (Robotech), Mospeada, Generator Gawl, Time Bokan, and Karas.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
