          "description": "A prominent director and a key member of [Kyoto Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/2/).\n\nAfter graduating from Osaka Designers' College in the late '80s, Ishihara joined Kyoto Animation and began his career as an animator. In 1991, he made his debut as a director with [Shiawasette Naani](https://anilist.co/anime/13441/). After that, he switched his focus to directing. Back then Kyoto Animation was still a sub-contracting studio, so therefore Ishihara could only get a handful of opportunities directing. Some of the shows in which Ishihara got to direct multiple episodes were [Tenchi Muyou!](https://anilist.co/anime/696/), [Aka-chan to Boku](https://anilist.co/anime/1485/), [Hyper Police](https://anilist.co/anime/1180/), and [Inuyasha](https://anilist.co/anime/249/). He also storyboarded the majority of the episodes he directed.\n\nIn 2003, Kyoto Animation started their transformation into a full-fledged animation studio producing their first anime series, [Fullmetal Panic? Fumoffu](https://anilist.co/anime/72/). Ishihara directed and storyboarded the 7th episode of the show. Two years later in 2005, he made his proper directorial debut directing the studio's second TV show, [Air](https://anilist.co/anime/101/). The following year he directed the award winning anime series, [The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://anilist.co/anime/849/). From here Ishihara has gone on to direct multiple of Kyoto Animation's acclaimed works.",

He graduated from Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1986. Sahashi has composed music for various anime series (including OVAs, films, and drama CDs), video games, films, dramas, and musicals.\n\nThe style of his composition is richly symphonic and classical (occasionally jazz). The use of sophisticated compositional techniques, as well as complicated harmony writing such as fugue can often be heard in his work, demonstrating his solid training in the western classical music. He also uses keyboard instruments to deliver more sentimental soundtracks to good effect.",
