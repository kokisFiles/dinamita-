Born in Tokyo in 1960, Urasawa debuted with BETA! in 1983 and hasn't stopped his impressive output since. Well-versed in a variety of genres, Urasawa's oeuvre encompasses a multitude of different subjects, such as a romantic comedy ([Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl](https://anilist.co/manga/30853/Yawara/)), a suspenseful human drama about a former mercenary ([Pineapple ARMY](https://anilist.co/manga/30859/Pineapple-Army/); story by [Kazuya Kudo](https://anilist.co/staff/97206/Kazuya-Kudo)), a captivating psychological suspense story ([Monster](https://anilist.co/manga/30001/Monster/)), a sci-fi adventure manga ([20th Century Boys](https://anilist.co/manga/30003/20th-Century-Boys/)), and a modern reinterpretation of the work of the God of Manga, [Osamu Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/96938/Osamu-Tezuka) ([Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka](https://anilist.co/manga/30745/Pluto/); co-authored with [Takashi Nagasaki](https://anilist.co/staff/112205/Takashi-Nagasaki), supervised by [Makoto Tezuka](https://anilist.co/staff/104143/Makoto-Tezuka), and with the cooperation of [Tezuka Productions](https://anilist.co/studio/200/Tezuka-Productions)). Many of his books have spawned popular animated and live-action TV programs and films, and 2008 saw the theatrical release of the first of three live-action Japanese films based on 20th Century Boys.  \n\nNo stranger to accolades and awards, Urasawa is a three-time recipient of the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award, a two-time recipient of the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, and has received the Kodansha Manga Award. Similarly, Monster has been nominated twice for the Eisner Award in America. Urasawa has also become involved in the world of academia, and in 2008 accepted a guest teaching post at Nagoya Zokei University, where he teaches courses in, of course, manga.",

          "description": "Shigeyuki Hayashi, better known by his pseudonym Rintarou, is a well-known anime director.\n\nA film buff ever since he was a kid, he wanted to pursue a career in filmmaking. After having worked as a cel painter in commercial animation, he joined [Toei Animation](https://anilist.co/studio/18/) in 1958 for a brief time working on films such as [Hakujaden](https://anilist.co/anime/4513/) and [Saiyuuki](https://anilist.co/anime/4481/). After having been told that he couldn't work as a director due to not being a college graduate, he moved to [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) - making his directorial debut as one of the regular episode directors on [Tetsuwan Atom](https://anilist.co/anime/2747/).\n\nIn 1972, Rintarou left Mushi Pro to go freelance and to co-found [Madhouse](https://anilist.co/studio/11) together with [Masao Maruyama](https://anilist.co/staff/103170/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/). A few years later, Rintarou got invited to direct [Jetter Mars](https://anilist.co/anime/6087/) at his previously disinterested workplace, Toei Animation. He accepted the offer but didn't join the studio as an employee, making him one of the few people who've directed for the studio while not being an inhouse employee. He continued to direct multiple entries for Toei, including [Arrow Emblem](https://anilist.co/anime/3800/), [Captain Harlock](https://anilist.co/anime/1000/), as well as the 1979 film [Galaxy Express 999](https://anilist.co/anime/1301/), which is still considered by many as his best work.\n\n[Haruki Kadokawa](https://anilist.co/staff/170354/), the president of [Kadokawa Shoten](https://anilist.co/studio/113/), took notice of the commercial success of Rintarou's works and hired him to direct [Genma Taisen](https://anilist.co/anime/1626/), which was the very first film produced by Kadokawa. The animation production was handled by Madhouse, where Rintarou changed his post at this time. There he continued his directorial efforts with numerous films and OVA series.\n\nThe older brother of [Masayuki Hayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/161046/).",

He has since worked on numerous of Miyazaki's and [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/)'s films as both an animator and an animation director.\n\nIn 2003, he directed the cycling anime film, [Nasu: Summer in Andalusia](https://anilist.co/anime/1209/), set on the Vuelta a España road bicycle race, adapted from [Iou Kuroda](https://anilist.co/staff/97910/)'s manga [Nasu](https://anilist.co/manga/31245/), which Miyazaki, a fan of cycling, had recommended to Kousaka. The film soon went on to become the first Japanese anime film ever to be selected for the Cannes Film Festival.",

He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at [Mappa](https://anilist.co/studio/569/).\n\nMaruyama graduated from Hosei University in 1963, and soon after, he found work at [Mushi Production](https://anilist.co/studio/68/) in 1965. It was here that he met many of Madhouse's future staff members. In October 1972, he left Mushi Production together with [Rintarou](https://anilist.co/staff/102305/), [Osamu Dezaki](https://anilist.co/staff/100393/) and [Yoshiaki Kawajiri](https://anilist.co/staff/100812/) and founded Madhouse. From that time onward, Maruyama focused mainly on producing and planning Madhouse's upcoming projects. He also served as the studio's president through the '80s and '90s.\n\nThanks in large part to his frequent attendance at anime conventions, he has become well-known in America among Madhouse's fanbase. Not simply wanting to emulate past successes, Maruyama frequently says at these events that his goal as a producer is to seek out new challenges that will allow the production staff to keep experimenting. This attitude in part has been the reason why he has encouraged the studio to take on projects that may not seem like sure-fire commercial hits. In addition, Maruyama has long been a supporter of bringing new talents into the animation business, and continues to encourage young people to work in anime.\n\nIn 2011, he left Madhouse and founded Mappa. Later in 2016, he left Mappa and founded Studio M2.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Production, debuting as an in-betweener on [Moero Arthur: Hakuba no Ouji](https://anilist.co/anime/4614/), and as a key animator on [Minami no Niji no Lucy](https://anilist.co/anime/2573/) in 1982, and got instructed by animators like [Toshitsugu Saida](https://anilist.co/staff/186591/) and [Kouichi Murata](https://anilist.co/staff/191548/).\n\nBefore having gone freelance in 1986, he had partaken in [Nausicaä](https://anilist.co/anime/572/) as an animator, working alongide famed director [Hayao Miyazaki](https://anilist.co/staff/96870/), whose work he himself is an admitted fan. He has since worked on numerous of Miyazaki's and [Ghibli](https://anilist.co/studio/21/)'s films as both an animator and an animation director.\n\nIn 2003, he directed the cycling anime film, [Nasu: Summer in Andalusia](https://anilist.co/anime/1209/), set on the Vuelta a España road bicycle race, adapted from [Iou Kuroda](https://anilist.co/staff/97910/)'s manga [Nasu](https://anilist.co/manga/31245/), which Miyazaki, a fan of cycling, had recommended to Kousaka. The film soon went on to become the first Japanese anime film ever to be selected for the Cannes Film Festival.",
