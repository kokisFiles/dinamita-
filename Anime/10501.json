  "description": "Young Mari hates eating vegetables and drinking milk so much that she has nightmares about being force-fed the items. One day at school, the young girl chokes down her milk and vegetables and promptly faints from the shock. When she wakes up in the nurse’s office, she comes face to face with Ninninman, Piman and Milk, three food sprites that only appear when Mari drinks her milk and eats her carrots and peppers. Though Mari is less than enthusiastic about being haunted by her most hated foodstuffs, can the three spirits help her realize the importance of friendship, and maybe even teach her to finish her meals?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Agency of Cultural Affairs of Japan invested 214 million yen ($2.26 million) in \"Young Animator Training Project\" and entrusted the execution of the project to Japan Animation Creators Association (JaniCA). JaniCA will produce four original anime (23 min long with OP and ED sequences) in cooperation with four production studios. Bannou Yasai Ninninman is one of these four projects.",
