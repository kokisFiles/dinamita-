The studio's policy at the time was not to employ women as directors, and although she scored top marks in the exam, she was encouraged to try writing screenplays instead. She made her debut with a script for episode 42 of Dr. Slump: Arale-chan, which was aired on 10 February 1982. After that, she established a successful career in scriptwriting.

His next station was Ghibli, where he once again worked as animator on most of the Studio's early works. In 1986 he co-founded Studio 4°C. He rejoined Nippon Animation to resume working on the World Masterpiece Theater series until its termination in 1997. He became a freelancer but eventually joined Taito, where he worked until March 2009.
