  "description": "The year is 2314 AD, two years after Celestial Being's last great battle and the world faces a new crisis. A derelict Jupiter exploration ship, abandoned 130 years ago, has left its orbit and is approaching Earth. The ESF has also begun to exploit the power of Innovators through Descartes Shaman. The world's exposure to GN Particles has resulted in many people awakening as True Innovators. Realizing the military benefits of such individuals, the Earth Sphere Federation has begun to research Innovation and exploit the emerging Innovators' abilities. As Celestial Being and its Gundam Meisters begin their final mission to save humanity from an unimaginable threat, the Extraterrestrial Living-metal Shape-shifters (ELS), Gundam Meister Setsuna F. Seiei is about to discover the true purpose of his evolution as an Innovator and the nature of the \"dialogues\" for which Aeolia Schenberg's plan had prepared the human race.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

She is married to fellow mangaka Tatsuneko and has a daughter. Yun began her career as a doujinshi artist creating doujinshi for works such as Saint Seiya, Captain Tsubasa and Maouden. She debuted in a commercial magazine with the original work Metal Heart (serialised in Kobunsha's Comic VAL from November 1986). After her debut, she continued to contribute on numerous doujin works. However, the later disbanding of a doujin circle, Yajou Teikoku, she had founded with Maki Chikura, led to her taking numerous breaks from her commercial works. Due to this, there were incomplete works penned by her during this period.\n\nDuring her years in middle school, she had been a fan of Masami Kurumada's manga series Ring ni Kakero, Fuuma no Kojirou, Saint Seiya and B't X (serialised in Weekly Shounen Jump), sending Kurumada numerous fan letters asking to meet him, after which Kurumada finally agreed, inviting her to his workplace.\n\nWhen asked about her penname in an interview in the September 2006 issue of Puff, she responded that she had originally thought of making it Kouga Jun, but subsequently changed it to Kouga Yun.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The band's name \"Uverworld\" is a term coined by the band members, which they did by combining the German word \"über\" (meaning over) with the English word \"world\"  to form a phrase that means \"crossing above the world\".\n\nAs a band they have released a total of nine studio albums and over twenty singles, which all garnered quite the success. They have also sold over three million records worldwide. The band is influenced by 1960s rock bands like The Beatles, The Zombies and The Beach Boys. The style became so popular it was later influenced by The Cookies, The Kinks and The Cramps. Vocalist Takuya Shimizu later cited Frank Sinatra, Queen, David Bowie, Weezer, Green Day and My Chemical Romance as the influencers for the band.\n\n__Biography:__\nThe six-piece band known as UVERworld first formed back in 2000, and were at the time known as Sound Goku Road, (or alternatively more popularily known as \"Sangoku Road\" in the independent music scene). The band originally consisted of seven members, and at the time released a demo CD titled Prime'03. This CD ended up selling 3000 copies, and as an unfortunate follow-up to the CD, two of the band members ultimately decided to leave. The members who left were their saxophonist Seika, and their second-man vocalist Ryohei. After Seika's departure their vocalist Ace∞trigger renamed himself to TAKUYA∞, while the band also renamed to UVERworld.\n\nIn 2005, the band signed with record label gr8! records. The band made their debut with the single titled \"D-technolife\", which was used as the second opening theme to the now famous anime Bleach.
